The perceptron algorithm always leads to better classification of the <em>training</em> data, but the opposite can happen for data which is not in the training set. The basic reason for this is that the perceptron first learns very general rules (such that words ending with <em>-ed</em> tend to be verbs), but later during training starts finding more and more specific rules (such that words ending with <em>-ent</em> that are longer than 7 letters and begin with <em>emba-</em> tend to be nouns -- this happens to fit the noun <em>embarrassment</em>, but is not a general rule of English grammar).</p>\n"
