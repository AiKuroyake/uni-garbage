Tagged corpora for several other languages are distributed with NLTK, including Chinese, 
Hindi, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and Catalan. These usually contain non-ASCII text, 
and Python always displays this in hexadecimal when printing a larger structure such as a list.

Unicode supports over a million characters. Each character is assigned a number, called 
a code point. In Python, code points are written in the form \uXXXX, where XXXX is the 
number in four-digit hexadecimal form.
