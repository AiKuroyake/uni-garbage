       "\"When the phone lines opened for a new age group to book coronavirus vaccination appointments in Oulu, more than 3,500 calls flooded in a matter of hours.\\nIt's a similar situation nationwide.\\nIn Helsinki people often try to make vaccination appointments ahead of time, while the majority of calls to the appointment booking service in Kainuu come from individuals not yet eligible for the jabs.\\nYle gathered some of the most common questions people ask when calling the vaccination appointment lines and put them to two experts, Sirkku Kaltakari, service manager at Oulu Social and Health Services, and infectious diseases doctor Jarkko Huusko.\\nHere are their answers:\\n1. How do I know if it's my turn to get the vaccine?\\nVaccinations are given according to a nationally-agreed schedule. The website of the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) contains information on the order of vaccinations by age and risk groups.\\nIf you can't find the information you need there, you can call your own health centre.\\nStory continues after the image.\\nThe current vaccination schedule according to THL. THL\\n2. How was the vaccination schedule decided?\\nThe schedule was decided by the National Advisory Committee on Vaccines (KRAR), which is appointed by THL and is being strictly followed.\\nAge is the most significant risk factor for coronavirus, which is why the elderly are being vaccinated first.\\n3. I booked an appointment online. How do I know if it worked?\\nYou don't need to confirm an appointment you booked online by calling. In Oulu, for example, you can choose to receive a confirmation by email when you book your time slot.\\n4. Can I get the brand of vaccine I want?\\nFor now, it is not possible to choose which brand of coronavirus vaccine you will receive.\\nA number of different coronavirus vaccines have been approved for use by the European Medicines Agency. Jarkko Riikonen / Yle\\n5. Can a carer get vaccinated at the same time as the person they care for? \\nCarers living in the same household as the person they care for can be vaccinated. The appointment for both the care giver and care receiver can be reserved at the same time. People receiving regular care at home and their carers will receive the vaccine via their home care service.\\n6. Can you get vaccinated if you've already had the coronavirus? What about other illnesses or medical treatments? \\nIf you've had the coronavirus you can still get the vaccine, but there's no rush to get vaccinated. It's currently thought that recovering from the illness provides protection from new infection for up to six months.\\nSuffering from an infectious disease is a reason to delay vaccination. You can only get vaccinated when you're healthy and have recovered from the infection.\\nAfter receiving chemotherapy it's a good idea to let your body recover for a few days so your immune system can respond to the vaccine. High-dose cortisone treatment is also a barrier to getting vaccinated.\\n7. Can the vaccine give you coronavirus?\\nNo it can't.\\nThe vaccine may cause mild and brief symptoms near the injection site in some patients. General symptoms can include hot flushes, redness, swelling, pain or swelling of the lymph nodes.\\nSome people might also experience mild general symptoms like tiredness, feeling unwell or having a temperature, according to the experts.\""
