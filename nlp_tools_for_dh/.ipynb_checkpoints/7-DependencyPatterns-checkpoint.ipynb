      "In addition, it was decided to postpone the municipal elections due to the difficult public health situation.\n",
      "Rallies against coronavirus restrictions are taking place in some 40 countries around the world on Saturday.\n",
      "Jussi Halla-aho, chair of the Finns Party, and the party's parliamentary group leader, Ville Tavio,on Saturday claimed Justice Minister Anna-Maja Henriksson had misled citizens and instructed municipalities to break the law in the lead-up to the decision to postpone this spring's municipal elections.\n",
      "On Friday, Parliament's Constitutional Law Committee unanimously approved the postponement of the municipal elections from 18 April until 13 June.\n",
      "According to senior police, Saturday's demonstration against coronavirus restrictions in downtown Helsinki will not set a precedent for future demonstrations.\n",
      "Many people on social media have questioned why the police allowed demonstrators to break current coronavirus restrictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question now is whether the protest will possibly give citizens the impression that coronavirus restrictions can be freely broken.\n",
      "One of the top-read stories on Finland's largest daily Helsingin Sanomat on Tuesday is experts' views on whether and when tougher coronavirus restrictions should be brought in.\n",
      "This is despite the fact that in the last municipal elections in 2017, more women were elected into municipal councils than ever before.\n",
      "Last autumn, the Association of Finnish Local and Regional Authorities investigated the reasons that affect people's willingness to run for office in municipal elections.\n",
      "The company said that the move was prompted by the negative economic impact of tightening coronavirus restrictions.\n",
      "While Stockmann's online store continues to operate, the company said the aim was to reduce the number of staff working in store in anticipation of tighter coronavirus restrictions that would prevent customers from shopping in person, as well as offsetting the loss of revenue caused by the pandemic.\n",
      "The Finns Party had filed the no-confidence motion against Justice Minister Anna-Maja Henriksson, claiming she had misled citizens and instructed municipalities to break the law in the lead-up to the decision to postpone this spring's municipal elections.\n",
      "Parliament also voted to approve the postponement of the municipal elections from 18 April until 13 June.\n",
      "Henriksson recalled that eight of the nine parliamentary parties and the Parliamentary Constitution Committee approved the postponement of the municipal elections.\n",
      "\"It would have been possible to hold municipal elections in April, but not responsibly,\" Henriksson added.\n",
      "Both parties enjoy higher levels of support in parts of the south and southwest which are currently under tightened coronavirus restrictions.\n",
      "An estimated 150 people have gathered in the city of Turku in Southwest Finland on Saturday afternoon to protest against coronavirus restrictions.\n",
      "The race at the top remains tight, with the three parties fighting a close battle for first place in the delayed municipal elections, set for 13 June.\n",
      "Improved support for the National Coalition Party bodes well for them in the municipal elections.\n",
      "\"At the moment, it is of paramount importance for the Centre that they get their potential supporters to the ballot box if the party wants a reasonable result in the municipal elections,\" Turja said.\n",
      "At 12.5 percent, support for the Centre is currently five percentage points lower than in the last municipal elections in 2017.\n",
      "Support for the Swedish People's Party has not shifted at all, although its leader, Justice Minister Anna-Maja Henriksson, was heavily criticised for postponing the municipal elections.\n",
      "According to Turja, the approach of the municipal elections is reflected in the fact that the popularity of groups outside Parliament increased slightly in the support survey.\n",
      "The country is at the height of the spread of seasonal street dust, but current coronavirus restrictions may be providing some relief from this annual predicament, according to Pia Anttila, a researcher at the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI).\n",
      "In March last year, the cruise ship industry halted most passenger traffic due to coronavirus restrictions imposed by the authorities.\n",
      "An international comparative study of 11 countries has found people in Finland were the most committed to complying with coronavirus restrictions.\n",
      "\"Citizens are prepared to comply with coronavirus restrictions that restrict their own fundamental rights if they are perceived to be effective.\n",
      "Helsinki Police suspect 46 people of violating restrictions on public gatherings during a demonstration against coronavirus restrictions held in the capital on 20 March.\n",
      "Due to coronavirus restrictions on travel and bars, Alko's position as an alcohol vendor was significantly improved, which was reflected in its revenues.\n",

      "Finland's government has prepared a draft plan for the gradual relaxing and removal of coronavirus restrictions, beginning this month with the end of partial shutdown.\n",
      "Plans for the gradual easing of coronavirus restrictions look to be on schedule, a government source has reportedly told Iltalehti.\n",
      "The group invited the public to join the event on its website, without any mention of coronavirus restrictions on group size.\n",
      "Last month Henriksson sailed through a confidence vote in Parliament, brought by opposition parties critical of her handling of the postponement of municipal elections from April to June.\n",
