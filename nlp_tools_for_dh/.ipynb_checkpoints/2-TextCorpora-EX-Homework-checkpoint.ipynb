There isn't a perfect way to clean the data, since every project finds a bit different features of data irrelevant. For example, some projects may want to keep numbers in their data and some not. \n",

      "transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back,\n",
      "and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed\n",
      "and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover\n",
      "it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin\n",
      "compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    “What’s happened to me?” he thought. It wasn’t a dream.\n",
      "His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully\n",
      "between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out\n",
      "on the table—Samsa was a travelling salesman—and above it there\n",
      "hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and\n",
      "housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and\n",
      "fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her\n",
      "lower arm towards the viewer.\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of rain\n",
      "could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad. “How\n",
      "about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense”, he\n",
      "thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to\n",
      "sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn’t get into that\n",
      "position. However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back\n",
      "to where he was. He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that\n",
      "he wouldn’t have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when\n",
      "he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before.\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    “Oh, God”, he thought, “what a strenuous career it is that\n",
      "I’ve chosen! Travelling day in and day out. Doing business like this\n",
      "takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that\n",
      "there’s the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections,\n",
      "bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that you\n",
      "can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to\n",
      "Hell!” He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on\n",
      "his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; found\n",
      "where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots\n",
      "which he didn’t know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the place\n",
      "with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it\n",
      "he was overcome by a cold shudder.\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    He slid back into his former position. “Getting up early all the\n",
      "time”, he thought, “it makes you stupid. You’ve got to get\n",
      "enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance,\n",
      "whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the\n",
      "contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their\n",
      "breakfasts. I ought to just try that with my boss; I’d get kicked out on\n",
      "the spot. But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I\n",
      "didn’t have my parents to think about I’d have given in my notice a\n",
      "long time ago, I’d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I\n",
      "think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He’d\n",
      "fall right off his desk! And it’s a funny sort of business to be sitting\n",
      "up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there,\n",
      "especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of\n",
      "hearing. Well, there’s still some hope; once I’ve got the money\n",
      "together to pay off my parents’ debt to him—another five or six\n",
      "years I suppose—that’s definitely what I’ll do. That’s\n",
      "when I’ll make the big change. First of all though, I’ve got to get\n",

      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers.\n",
      "“God in Heaven!” he thought. It was half past six and the hands\n",
      "were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like\n",
      "quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the bed that\n",
      "it had been set for four o’clock as it should have been; it certainly\n",
      "must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that\n",
      "furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all\n",
      "the more deeply because of that. What should he do now? The next train went at\n",
      "seven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the\n",
      "collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at all feel\n",
      "particularly fresh and lively. And even if he did catch the train he would not\n",
      "avoid his boss’s anger as the office assistant would have been there to\n",
      "see the five o’clock train go, he would have put in his report about\n",
      "Gregor’s not being there a long time ago. The office assistant was the\n",
      "boss’s man, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he\n",
      "reported sick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in\n",
      "fifteen years of service Gregor had never once yet been ill. His boss would\n",
      "certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse\n",
      "his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the doctor’s recommendation\n",
      "not to make any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that\n",
      "many were workshy. And what’s more, would he have been entirely wrong in\n",
      "this case? Gregor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping\n",
      "for so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    He was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to get out\n",
      "of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven. There was a cautious knock\n",
      "at the door near his head. “Gregor”, somebody called—it was\n",
      "his mother—“it’s quarter to seven. Didn’t you want to\n",
      "go somewhere?” That gentle voice! Gregor was shocked when he heard his\n",
      "own voice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had\n",
      "before. As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and uncontrollable\n",
      "squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out at first but then there\n",
      "was a sort of echo which made them unclear, leaving the hearer unsure whether\n",
      "he had heard properly or not. Gregor had wanted to give a full answer and\n",
      "explain everything, but in the circumstances contented himself with saying:\n",
      "“Yes, mother, yes, thank-you, I’m getting up now.” The change\n",
      "in Gregor’s voice probably could not be noticed outside through the\n",
      "wooden door, as his mother was satisfied with this explanation and shuffled\n",
      "away. But this short conversation made the other members of the family aware\n",
      "that Gregor, against their expectations was still at home, and soon his father\n",
      "came knocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist.\n",
      "“Gregor, Gregor”, he called, “what’s wrong?” And\n",
      "after a short while he called again with a warning deepness in his voice:\n",
      "“Gregor! Gregor!” At the other side door his sister came\n",
      "plaintively: “Gregor? Aren’t you well? Do you need anything?”\n",
      "Gregor answered to both sides: “I’m ready, now”, making an\n",
      "effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by enunciating very\n",
      "carefully and putting long pauses between each, individual word. His father\n",
      "went back to his breakfast, but his sister whispered: “Gregor, open the\n",
      "door, I beg of you.” Gregor, however, had no thought of opening the door,\n",

      "    The first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed,\n",

      "his hands to push himself up; but instead of them he only had all those little\n",
      "legs continuously moving in different directions, and which he was moreover\n",
      "unable to control. If he wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first\n",
      "one that would stretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do what he\n",
      "wanted with that leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about\n",
      "painfully. “This is something that can’t be done in bed”,\n",
      "Gregor said to himself, “so don’t keep trying to do it”.\n",

      "   <p>\n",
      "    The first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out of the\n",
      "bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could not imagine what it\n",
      "looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move; it went so slowly; and\n",
      "finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly shoved himself forwards with\n",
      "all the force he could gather, he chose the wrong direction, hit hard against\n",
      "the lower bedpost, and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lower\n",
      "part of his body might well, at present, be the most sensitive.\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first,\n",

      "despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of his body eventually followed\n",
      "slowly in the direction of the head. But when he had at last got his head out\n",
      "of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him that if he let himself\n",
      "fall it would be a miracle if his head were not injured, so he became afraid to\n",
      "carry on pushing himself forward the same way. And he could not knock himself\n",
      "out now at any price; better to stay in bed than lose consciousness.\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    It took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier, but when\n",
      "he lay there sighing, and was once more watching his legs as they struggled\n",
      "against each other even harder than before, if that was possible, he could\n",
      "think of no way of bringing peace and order to this chaos. He told himself once\n",
      "more that it was not possible for him to stay in bed and that the most sensible\n",
      "thing to do would be to get free of it in whatever way he could at whatever\n",
      "sacrifice. At the same time, though, he did not forget to remind himself that\n",
      "calm consideration was much better than rushing to desperate conclusions. At\n",
      "times like this he would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly\n",
      "as he could, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was\n",
      "enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to offer\n",
      "him. “Seven o’clock, already”, he said to himself when the\n",
      "clock struck again, “seven o’clock, and there’s still a fog\n",
      "like this.” And he lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as\n",
      "if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back to their real\n",
      "and natural state.\n",
      "   </p>\n",
      "   <p>\n",
      "    But then he said to himself: “Before it strikes quarter past seven\n",
      "I’ll definitely have to have got properly out of bed. And by then\n",
      "somebody will have come round from work to ask what’s happened to me as\n",
      "well, as they open up at work before seven o’clock.” And so he set\n",
      "himself to the task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed\n",
      "all at the same time. If he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and\n",
      "kept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it. His back\n",
      "seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to it falling onto\n",
      "the carpet. His main concern was for the loud noise he was bound to make, and\n",
      "which even through all the doors would probably raise concern if not alarm. But\n",

      "was more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock back and\n",
      "forth—it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody came\n",
      "to help him. Two strong people—he had his father and the maid in\n",
      "mind—would have been more than enough; they would only have to push their\n",
      "arms under the dome of his back, peel him away from the bed, bend down with the\n",
      "load and then be patient and careful as he swang over onto the floor, where,\n",
      "hopefully, the little legs would find a use. Should he really call for help\n",
      "though, even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked? Despite all\n",

      "   <p>\n",

      "ring at the door of the flat. “That’ll be someone from work”,\n",
      "he said to himself, and froze very still, although his little legs only became\n",
      "all the more lively as they danced around. For a moment everything remained\n",
      "quiet. “They’re not opening the door”, Gregor said to\n",
      "himself, caught in some nonsensical hope. But then of course, the maid’s\n",
      "firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it. Gregor only needed to hear\n",
      "the visitor’s first words of greeting and he knew who it was—the\n",

      "couple of hours in the morning on company business? Was it really not enough to\n",
      "let one of the trainees make enquiries—assuming enquiries were even\n",
      "necessary—did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did they have to\n",
      "show the whole, innocent family that this was so suspicious that only the chief\n",
      "clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate it? And more because\n",
      "these thoughts had made him upset than through any proper decision, he swang\n",
      "himself with all his force out of the bed. There was a loud thump, but it\n",
      "wasn’t really a loud noise. His fall was softened a little by the carpet,\n",
      "and Gregor’s back was also more elastic than he had thought, which made\n",
      "the sound muffled and not too noticeable. He had not held his head carefully\n",
      "enough, though, and hit it as he fell; annoyed and in pain, he turned it and\n",
      "rubbed it against the carpet.\n",

      "unfolded her arms, took two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the\n",

      "into the doorway without regard for what might happen. One side of his body\n",
      "lifted itself, he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the\n",

      "which he was now beginning to learn the value—in order to see what had\n",
      "been happening there. The whole of his left side seemed like one, painfully\n",

      "forward, right to the edge of the couch, and watched her. Would she notice that\n",
      "he had left the milk as it was, realise that it was not from any lack of hunger\n",
      "and bring him in some other food that was more suitable? If she didn’t do\n",

      "sister noticed the full dish immediately and looked at it and the few drops of\n",
      "milk splashed around it with some surprise. She immediately picked it\n",
      "up—using a rag, not her bare hands—and carried it out. Gregor was\n",
      "extremely curious as to what she would bring in its place, imagining the\n",
      "wildest possibilities, but he never could have guessed what his sister, in her\n",
      "goodness, actually did bring. In order to test his taste, she brought him a\n",
      "whole selection of things, all spread out on an old newspaper. There were old,\n",
      "half-rotten vegetables; bones from the evening meal, covered in white sauce\n",
      "that had gone hard; a few raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had\n",
      "declared inedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread with butter\n",
      "and salt. As well as all that she had poured some water into the dish, which\n",
      "had probably been permanently set aside for Gregor’s use, and placed it\n",
      "beside them. Then, out of consideration for Gregor’s feelings, as she\n",
      "knew that he would not eat in front of her, she hurried out again and even\n",
      "turned the key in the lock so that Gregor would know he could make things as\n",
      "comfortable for himself as he liked. Gregor’s little legs whirred, at\n",
      "last he could eat. What’s more, his injuries must already have completely\n",
      "healed as he found no difficulty in moving. This amazed him, as more than a\n",
      "month earlier he had cut his finger slightly with a knife, he thought of how\n",
      "his finger had still hurt the day before yesterday. “Am I less sensitive\n",
      "than I used to be, then?”, he thought, and was already sucking greedily\n",
      "at the cheese which had immediately, almost compellingly, attracted him much\n",
      "more than the other foods on the newspaper. Quickly one after another, his eyes\n",
      "watering with pleasure, he consumed the cheese, the vegetables and the sauce;\n",
      "the fresh foods, on the other hand, he didn’t like at all, and even\n",
      "dragged the things he did want to eat a little way away from them because he\n",
      "couldn’t stand the smell. Long after he had finished eating and lay\n",
      "lethargic in the same place, his sister slowly turned the key in the lock as a\n",
      "sign to him that he should withdraw. He was immediately startled, although he\n",
      "had been half asleep, and he hurried back under the couch. But he needed great\n",
      "self-control to stay there even for the short time that his sister was in the\n",
      "room, as eating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he could\n",
      "hardly breathe in that narrow space. Half suffocating, he watched with bulging\n",

      "mixing them in with the food he had not even touched at all as if it could not\n",

      "his sister came in and looked round to see that everything in the room was\n",
      "alright; and only then did she let her mother enter. Gregor had hurriedly\n",
      "pulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put more folds into it so that\n",
      "everything really looked as if it had just been thrown down by chance. Gregor\n",
      "also refrained, this time, from spying out from under the sheet; he gave up the\n",

      "things’ being tidy. This meant not only in their own room but, since they\n",
      "had taken a room in this establishment, in the entire flat and especially in\n",

      "there was now all the more reason to keep himself hidden as he was covered in\n",
      "the dust that lay everywhere in his room and flew up at the slightest movement;\n",
      "he carried threads, hairs, and remains of food about on his back and sides; he\n",

      "playing but had been disappointed, that they had had enough of the whole\n",

      "to be disturbed. It was especially unnerving, the way they all blew the smoke\n",
      "from their cigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses. Yet Gregor’s\n",
      "sister was playing so beautifully. Her face was leant to one side, following\n",
      "the lines of music with a careful and melancholy expression. Gregor crawled a\n",
      "little further forward, keeping his head close to the ground so that he could\n",
      "meet her eyes if the chance came. Was he an animal if music could captivate him\n",
      "so? It seemed to him that he was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment\n",
      "he had been yearning for. He was determined to make his way forward to his\n",

      "not be forced to stay with him, though, but stay of her own free will; she\n",

      "gone already?—if this misfortune hadn’t got in the way, and refuse\n",
      "to let anyone dissuade him from it. On hearing all this, his sister would break\n",
      "out in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her shoulder and kiss her\n",

      "He rushed up to them with his arms spread out and attempted to drive them back\n",
      "into their room at the same time as trying to block their view of Gregor with\n",
      "his body. Now they did become a little annoyed, and it was not clear whether it\n",
      "was his father’s behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning realisation\n",
      "that they had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room without knowing it.\n",
      "They asked Gregor’s father for explanations, raised their arms like he\n",
      "had, tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back towards their room only\n",
      "very slowly. Meanwhile Gregor’s sister had overcome the despair she had\n",
      "fallen into when her playing was suddenly interrupted. She had let her hands\n",
      "drop and let violin and bow hang limply for a while but continued to look at\n",
      "the music as if still playing, but then she suddenly pulled herself together,\n",
      "lay the instrument on her mother’s lap who still sat laboriously\n",
      "struggling for breath where she was, and ran into the next room which, under\n",
      "pressure from her father, the three gentlemen were more quickly moving toward.\n",
      "Under his sister’s experienced hand, the pillows and covers on the beds\n",
      "flew up and were put into order and she had already finished making the beds\n",

      "all the respect he owed to his tenants. He urged them and pressed them until,\n",
      "when he was already at the door of the room, the middle of the three gentlemen\n",
      "shouted like thunder and stamped his foot and thereby brought Gregor’s\n",
      "father to a halt. “I declare here and now”, he said, raising his\n",
      "hand and glancing at Gregor’s mother and sister to gain their attention\n",
      "too, “that with regard to the repugnant conditions that prevail in this\n",
      "flat and with this family”—here he looked briefly but decisively at\n",
      "the floor—“I give immediate notice on my room. For the days that I\n",
      "have been living here I will, of course, pay nothing at all, on the contrary I\n",
      "will consider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damages from you,\n",
      "and believe me it would be very easy to set out the grounds for such an\n",
      "action.” He was silent and looked straight ahead as if waiting for\n",
      "something. And indeed, his two friends joined in with the words: “And we\n",

      "doorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendous good news to\n",
      "report, but would only do it if she was clearly asked to. The almost vertical\n",
      "little ostrich feather on her hat, which had been a source of irritation to Mr.\n",
      "Samsa all the time she had been working for them, swayed gently in all\n",

      "into a friendly laugh that made her unable to speak straight away, “well\n",
      "then, that thing in there, you needn’t worry about how you’re going\n",
      "to get rid of it. That’s all been sorted out.” Mrs. Samsa and Grete\n",
      "bent down over their letters as if intent on continuing with what they were\n",
      "writing; Mr. Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing everything\n",
      "in detail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quite clear that she was not\n",
      "to. So, as she was prevented from telling them all about it, she suddenly\n",
      "remembered what a hurry she was in and, clearly peeved, called out\n",
      "“Cheerio then, everyone”, turned round sharply and left, slamming\n",
      "the door terribly as she went.\n",

      "from either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to have destroyed\n",
      "the peace they had only just gained. They got up and went over to the window\n",
      "where they remained with their arms around each other. Mr. Samsa twisted round\n",
      "in his chair to look at them and sat there watching for a while. Then he called\n",

      "we. Come and give me a bit of attention”. The two women immediately did\n",

      "One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself\n",
      "transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back,\n",
      "and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed\n",
      "and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover\n",
      "it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin\n",
      "compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s happened to me?” he thought. It wasn’t a dream.\n",
      "His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully\n",
      "between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out\n",
      "on the table—Samsa was a travelling salesman—and above it there\n",
      "hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and\n",
      "housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and\n",
      "fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her\n",
      "lower arm towards the viewer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of rain\n",
      "could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad. “How\n",
      "about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense”, he\n",
      "thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to\n",
      "sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn’t get into that\n",
      "position. However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back\n",
      "to where he was. He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that\n",
      "he wouldn’t have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when\n",
      "he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, God”, he thought, “what a strenuous career it is that\n",
      "I’ve chosen! Travelling day in and day out. Doing business like this\n",
      "takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that\n",
      "there’s the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections,\n",
      "bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that you\n",
      "can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to\n",
      "Hell!” He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on\n",
      "his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; found\n",
      "where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots\n",
      "which he didn’t know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the place\n",
      "with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it\n",
      "he was overcome by a cold shudder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He slid back into his former position. “Getting up early all the\n",
      "time”, he thought, “it makes you stupid. You’ve got to get\n",
      "enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance,\n",
      "whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the\n",
      "contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their\n",
      "breakfasts. I ought to just try that with my boss; I’d get kicked out on\n",
      "the spot. But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I\n",
      "didn’t have my parents to think about I’d have given in my notice a\n",
      "long time ago, I’d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I\n",
      "think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He’d\n",
      "fall right off his desk! And it’s a funny sort of business to be sitting\n",
      "up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there,\n",
      "especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of\n",
      "hearing. Well, there’s still some hope; once I’ve got the money\n",
      "together to pay off my parents’ debt to him—another five or six\n",
      "years I suppose—that’s definitely what I’ll do. That’s\n",
      "when I’ll make the big change. First of all though, I’ve got to get\n",
      "up, my train leaves at five.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers.\n",
      "“God in Heaven!” he thought. It was half past six and the hands\n",
      "were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like\n",
      "quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the bed that\n",
      "it had been set for four o’clock as it should have been; it certainly\n",
      "must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that\n",
      "furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all\n",
      "the more deeply because of that. What should he do now? The next train went at\n",
      "seven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the\n",
      "collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at all feel\n",
      "particularly fresh and lively. And even if he did catch the train he would not\n",
      "avoid his boss’s anger as the office assistant would have been there to\n",
      "see the five o’clock train go, he would have put in his report about\n",
      "Gregor’s not being there a long time ago. The office assistant was the\n",
      "boss’s man, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he\n",
      "reported sick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in\n",
      "fifteen years of service Gregor had never once yet been ill. His boss would\n",
      "certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse\n",
      "his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the doctor’s recommendation\n",
      "not to make any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that\n",
      "many were workshy. And what’s more, would he have been entirely wrong in\n",
      "this case? Gregor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping\n",
      "for so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to get out\n",
      "of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven. There was a cautious knock\n",
      "at the door near his head. “Gregor”, somebody called—it was\n",
      "his mother—“it’s quarter to seven. Didn’t you want to\n",
      "go somewhere?” That gentle voice! Gregor was shocked when he heard his\n",
      "own voice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had\n",
      "before. As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and uncontrollable\n",
      "squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out at first but then there\n",
      "was a sort of echo which made them unclear, leaving the hearer unsure whether\n",
      "he had heard properly or not. Gregor had wanted to give a full answer and\n",
      "explain everything, but in the circumstances contented himself with saying:\n",
      "“Yes, mother, yes, thank-you, I’m getting up now.” The change\n",
      "in Gregor’s voice probably could not be noticed outside through the\n",
      "wooden door, as his mother was satisfied with this explanation and shuffled\n",
      "away. But this short conversation made the other members of the family aware\n",
      "that Gregor, against their expectations was still at home, and soon his father\n",
      "came knocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist.\n",
      "“Gregor, Gregor”, he called, “what’s wrong?” And\n",
      "after a short while he called again with a warning deepness in his voice:\n",
      "“Gregor! Gregor!” At the other side door his sister came\n",
      "plaintively: “Gregor? Aren’t you well? Do you need anything?”\n",
      "Gregor answered to both sides: “I’m ready, now”, making an\n",
      "effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by enunciating very\n",
      "carefully and putting long pauses between each, individual word. His father\n",
      "went back to his breakfast, but his sister whispered: “Gregor, open the\n",
      "door, I beg of you.” Gregor, however, had no thought of opening the door,\n",
      "and instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit, acquired from his\n",
      "travelling, of locking all doors at night even when he was at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed,\n",
      "to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast. Only then would he\n",
      "consider what to do next, as he was well aware that he would not bring his\n",
      "thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in bed. He remembered that he had\n",
      "often felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps caused by lying awkwardly, but that\n",
      "had always turned out to be pure imagination and he wondered how his imaginings\n",
      "would slowly resolve themselves today. He did not have the slightest doubt that\n",
      "the change in his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold,\n",
      "which was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow himself up\n",
      "a little and they fell off by themselves. But it became difficult after that,\n",
      "especially as he was so exceptionally broad. He would have used his arms and\n",
      "his hands to push himself up; but instead of them he only had all those little\n",
      "legs continuously moving in different directions, and which he was moreover\n",
      "unable to control. If he wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first\n",
      "one that would stretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do what he\n",
      "wanted with that leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about\n",
      "painfully. “This is something that can’t be done in bed”,\n",
      "Gregor said to himself, “so don’t keep trying to do it”.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out of the\n",
      "bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could not imagine what it\n",
      "looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move; it went so slowly; and\n",
      "finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly shoved himself forwards with\n",
      "all the force he could gather, he chose the wrong direction, hit hard against\n",
      "the lower bedpost, and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lower\n",
      "part of his body might well, at present, be the most sensitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first,\n",
      "carefully turning his head to the side. This he managed quite easily, and\n",
      "despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of his body eventually followed\n",
      "slowly in the direction of the head. But when he had at last got his head out\n",
      "of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him that if he let himself\n",
      "fall it would be a miracle if his head were not injured, so he became afraid to\n",
      "carry on pushing himself forward the same way. And he could not knock himself\n",
      "out now at any price; better to stay in bed than lose consciousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier, but when\n",
      "he lay there sighing, and was once more watching his legs as they struggled\n",
      "against each other even harder than before, if that was possible, he could\n",
      "think of no way of bringing peace and order to this chaos. He told himself once\n",
      "more that it was not possible for him to stay in bed and that the most sensible\n",
      "thing to do would be to get free of it in whatever way he could at whatever\n",
      "sacrifice. At the same time, though, he did not forget to remind himself that\n",
      "calm consideration was much better than rushing to desperate conclusions. At\n",
      "times like this he would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly\n",
      "as he could, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was\n",
      "enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to offer\n",
      "him. “Seven o’clock, already”, he said to himself when the\n",
      "clock struck again, “seven o’clock, and there’s still a fog\n",
      "like this.” And he lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as\n",
      "if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back to their real\n",
      "and natural state.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But then he said to himself: “Before it strikes quarter past seven\n",
      "I’ll definitely have to have got properly out of bed. And by then\n",
      "somebody will have come round from work to ask what’s happened to me as\n",
      "well, as they open up at work before seven o’clock.” And so he set\n",
      "himself to the task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed\n",
      "all at the same time. If he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and\n",
      "kept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it. His back\n",
      "seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to it falling onto\n",
      "the carpet. His main concern was for the loud noise he was bound to make, and\n",
      "which even through all the doors would probably raise concern if not alarm. But\n",
      "it was something that had to be risked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed—the new method\n",
      "was more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock back and\n",
      "forth—it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody came\n",
      "to help him. Two strong people—he had his father and the maid in\n",
      "mind—would have been more than enough; they would only have to push their\n",
      "arms under the dome of his back, peel him away from the bed, bend down with the\n",
      "load and then be patient and careful as he swang over onto the floor, where,\n",
      "hopefully, the little legs would find a use. Should he really call for help\n",
      "though, even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked? Despite all\n",
      "the difficulty he was in, he could not suppress a smile at this thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while he had already moved so far across that it would have been hard\n",
      "for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard. The time was now ten past\n",
      "seven and he would have to make a final decision very soon. Then there was a\n",
      "ring at the door of the flat. “That’ll be someone from work”,\n",
      "he said to himself, and froze very still, although his little legs only became\n",
      "all the more lively as they danced around. For a moment everything remained\n",
      "quiet. “They’re not opening the door”, Gregor said to\n",
      "himself, caught in some nonsensical hope. But then of course, the maid’s\n",
      "firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it. Gregor only needed to hear\n",
      "the visitor’s first words of greeting and he knew who it was—the\n",
      "chief clerk himself. Why did Gregor have to be the only one condemned to work\n",
      "for a company where they immediately became highly suspicious at the slightest\n",
      "shortcoming? Were all employees, every one of them, louts, was there not one of\n",
      "them who was faithful and devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience\n",
      "that he couldn’t get out of bed if he didn’t spend at least a\n",
      "couple of hours in the morning on company business? Was it really not enough to\n",
      "let one of the trainees make enquiries—assuming enquiries were even\n",
      "necessary—did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did they have to\n",
      "show the whole, innocent family that this was so suspicious that only the chief\n",
      "clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate it? And more because\n",
      "these thoughts had made him upset than through any proper decision, he swang\n",
      "himself with all his force out of the bed. There was a loud thump, but it\n",
      "wasn’t really a loud noise. His fall was softened a little by the carpet,\n",
      "and Gregor’s back was also more elastic than he had thought, which made\n",
      "the sound muffled and not too noticeable. He had not held his head carefully\n",
      "enough, though, and hit it as he fell; annoyed and in pain, he turned it and\n",
      "rubbed it against the carpet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Something’s fallen down in there”, said the chief clerk in\n",
      "the room on the left. Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort\n",
      "that had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too; you\n",
      "had to concede that it was possible. But as if in gruff reply to this question,\n",
      "the chief clerk’s firm footsteps in his highly polished boots could now\n",
      "be heard in the adjoining room. From the room on his right, Gregor’s\n",
      "sister whispered to him to let him know: “Gregor, the chief clerk is\n",
      "here.” “Yes, I know”, said Gregor to himself; but without\n",
      "daring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gregor”, said his father now from the room to his left, “the\n",
      "chief clerk has come round and wants to know why you didn’t leave on the\n",
      "early train. We don’t know what to say to him. And anyway, he wants to\n",
      "speak to you personally. So please open up this door. I’m sure\n",
      "he’ll be good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room.” Then\n",
      "the chief clerk called “Good morning, Mr. Samsa”. “He\n",
      "isn’t well”, said his mother to the chief clerk, while his father\n",
      "continued to speak through the door. “He isn’t well, please believe\n",
      "me. Why else would Gregor have missed a train! The lad only ever thinks about\n",
      "the business. It nearly makes me cross the way he never goes out in the\n",
      "evenings; he’s been in town for a week now but stayed home every evening.\n",
      "He sits with us in the kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train\n",
      "timetables. His idea of relaxation is working with his fretsaw. He’s made\n",
      "a little frame, for instance, it only took him two or three evenings,\n",
      "you’ll be amazed how nice it is; it’s hanging up in his room;\n",
      "you’ll see it as soon as Gregor opens the door. Anyway, I’m glad\n",
      "you’re here; we wouldn’t have been able to get Gregor to open the\n",
      "door by ourselves; he’s so stubborn; and I’m sure he isn’t\n",
      "well, he said this morning that he is, but he isn’t.”\n",
      "“I’ll be there in a moment”, said Gregor slowly and\n",
      "thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any word of the\n",
      "conversation. “Well I can’t think of any other way of explaining\n",
      "it, Mrs. Samsa”, said the chief clerk, “I hope it’s nothing\n",
      "serious. But on the other hand, I must say that if we people in commerce ever\n",
      "become slightly unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as you like, we\n",
      "simply have to overcome it because of business considerations.”\n",
      "“Can the chief clerk come in to see you now then?”, asked his\n",
      "father impatiently, knocking at the door again. “No”, said Gregor.\n",
      "In the room on his right there followed a painful silence; in the room on his\n",
      "left his sister began to cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So why did his sister not go and join the others? She had probably only just\n",
      "got up and had not even begun to get dressed. And why was she crying? Was it\n",
      "because he had not got up, and had not let the chief clerk in, because he was\n",
      "in danger of losing his job and if that happened his boss would once more\n",
      "pursue their parents with the same demands as before? There was no need to\n",
      "worry about things like that yet. Gregor was still there and had not the\n",
      "slightest intention of abandoning his family. For the time being he just lay\n",
      "there on the carpet, and no-one who knew the condition he was in would\n",
      "seriously have expected him to let the chief clerk in. It was only a minor\n",
      "discourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later on, it\n",
      "was not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the spot. And it seemed\n",
      "to Gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace instead of disturbing\n",
      "him with talking at him and crying. But the others didn’t know what was\n",
      "happening, they were worried, that would excuse their behaviour.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The chief clerk now raised his voice, “Mr. Samsa”, he called to\n",
      "him, “what is wrong? You barricade yourself in your room, give us no more\n",
      "than yes or no for an answer, you are causing serious and unnecessary concern\n",
      "to your parents and you fail—and I mention this just by the way—you\n",
      "fail to carry out your business duties in a way that is quite unheard of.\n",
      "I’m speaking here on behalf of your parents and of your employer, and\n",
      "really must request a clear and immediate explanation. I am astonished, quite\n",
      "astonished. I thought I knew you as a calm and sensible person, and now you\n",
      "suddenly seem to be showing off with peculiar whims. This morning, your\n",
      "employer did suggest a possible reason for your failure to appear, it’s\n",
      "true—it had to do with the money that was recently entrusted to\n",
      "you—but I came near to giving him my word of honour that that could not\n",
      "be the right explanation. But now that I see your incomprehensible stubbornness\n",
      "I no longer feel any wish whatsoever to intercede on your behalf. And nor is\n",
      "your position all that secure. I had originally intended to say all this to you\n",
      "in private, but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good reason I\n",
      "don’t see why your parents should not also learn of it. Your turnover has\n",
      "been very unsatisfactory of late; I grant you that it’s not the time of\n",
      "year to do especially good business, we recognise that; but there simply is no\n",

      "easy as I’d thought. I’m quite alright now, though. It’s\n",

      "my parents know about it, perhaps better than me, I had a small symptom of it\n",
      "last night already. They must have noticed it. I don’t know why I\n",

      "eight o’clock train, as well, these few hours of rest have given me\n",

      "And while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he was saying, he\n",
      "made his way over to the chest of drawers—this was easily done, probably\n",
      "because of the practise he had already had in bed—where he now tried to\n",
      "get himself upright. He really did want to open the door, really did want to\n",
      "let them see him and to speak with the chief clerk; the others were being so\n",
      "insistent, and he was curious to learn what they would say when they caught\n",
      "sight of him. If they were shocked then it would no longer be Gregor’s\n",
      "responsibility and he could rest. If, however, they took everything calmly he\n",
      "would still have no reason to be upset, and if he hurried he really could be at\n",
      "the station for eight o’clock. The first few times he tried to climb up\n",
      "on the smooth chest of drawers he just slid down again, but he finally gave\n",
      "himself one last swing and stood there upright; the lower part of his body was\n",
      "in serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it. Now he let himself\n",
      "fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of it\n",
      "with his little legs. By now he had also calmed down, and kept quiet so that he\n",

      "“Oh, God!” called his mother, who was already in tears, “he\n",
      "could be seriously ill and we’re making him suffer. Grete! Grete!”\n",
      "she then cried. “Mother?” his sister called from the other side.\n",
      "They communicated across Gregor’s room. “You’ll have to go\n",
      "for the doctor straight away. Gregor is ill. Quick, get the doctor. Did you\n",
      "hear the way Gregor spoke just now?” “That was the voice of an\n",
      "animal”, said the chief clerk, with a calmness that was in contrast with\n",
      "his mother’s screams. “Anna! Anna!” his father called into\n",
      "the kitchen through the entrance hall, clapping his hands, “get a\n",
      "locksmith here, now!” And the two girls, their skirts swishing,\n",
      "immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open the front door of the flat\n",
      "as they went. How had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly? There was\n",
      "no sound of the door banging shut again; they must have left it open; people\n",
      "often do in homes where something awful has happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gregor, in contrast, had become much calmer. So they couldn’t understand\n",
      "his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to him, clearer than\n",
      "before—perhaps his ears had become used to the sound. They had realised,\n",
      "though, that there was something wrong with him, and were ready to help. The\n",
      "first response to his situation had been confident and wise, and that made him\n",
      "feel better. He felt that he had been drawn back in among people, and from the\n",
      "doctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprising\n",
      "achievements—although he did not really distinguish one from the other.\n",
      "Whatever was said next would be crucial, so, in order to make his voice as\n",
      "clear as possible, he coughed a little, but taking care to do this not too\n",
      "loudly as even this might well sound different from the way that a human coughs\n",
      "and he was no longer sure he could judge this for himself. Meanwhile, it had\n",
      "become very quiet in the next room. Perhaps his parents were sat at the table\n",
      "whispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all pressed against the\n",
      "door and listening.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair. Once there he let\n",
      "go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding himself upright against it\n",
      "using the adhesive on the tips of his legs. He rested there a little while to\n",
      "recover from the effort involved and then set himself to the task of turning\n",
      "the key in the lock with his mouth. He seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper\n",
      "teeth—how was he, then, to grasp the key?—but the lack of teeth\n",
      "was, of course, made up for with a very strong jaw; using the jaw, he really\n",
      "was able to start the key turning, ignoring the fact that he must have been\n",
      "causing some kind of damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth, flowed over\n",
      "the key and dripped onto the floor. “Listen”, said the chief clerk\n",
      "in the next room, “he’s turning the key.” Gregor was greatly\n",
      "encouraged by this; but they all should have been calling to him, his father\n",
      "and his mother too: “Well done, Gregor”, they should have cried,\n",
      "“keep at it, keep hold of the lock!” And with the idea that they\n",
      "were all excitedly following his efforts, he bit on the key with all his\n",
      "strength, paying no attention to the pain he was causing himself. As the key\n",
      "turned round he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself upright\n",
      "with his mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the whole\n",
      "weight of his body as needed. The clear sound of the lock as it snapped back\n",
      "was Gregor’s sign that he could break his concentration, and as he\n",
      "regained his breath he said to himself: “So, I didn’t need the\n",
      "locksmith after all”. Then he lay his head on the handle of the door to\n",
      "open it completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Because he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide open before he\n",
      "could be seen. He had first to slowly turn himself around one of the double\n",
      "doors, and he had to do it very carefully if he did not want to fall flat on\n",
      "his back before entering the room. He was still occupied with this difficult\n",
      "movement, unable to pay attention to anything else, when he heard the chief\n",
      "clerk exclaim a loud “Oh!”, which sounded like the soughing of the\n",
      "wind. Now he also saw him—he was the nearest to the door—his hand\n",
      "pressed against his open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven by a steady\n",
      "and invisible force. Gregor’s mother, her hair still dishevelled from bed\n",
      "despite the chief clerk’s being there, looked at his father. Then she\n",
      "unfolded her arms, took two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the\n",
      "floor into her skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head\n",
      "disappeared down onto her breast. His father looked hostile, and clenched his\n",
      "fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room. Then he looked\n",
      "uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with his hands and wept so\n",
      "that his powerful chest shook.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the other\n",
      "door which was still held bolted in place. In this way only half of his body\n",
      "could be seen, along with his head above it which he leant over to one side as\n",
      "he peered out at the others. Meanwhile the day had become much lighter; part of\n",
      "the endless, grey-black building on the other side of the street—which\n",
      "was a hospital—could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regular\n",

      "which way to turn. If only his father would stop that unbearable hissing! It\n",
      "was making Gregor quite confused. When he had nearly finished turning round,\n",
      "still listening to that hissing, he made a mistake and turned himself back a\n",

      "front of the doorway, but then saw that it was too narrow, and his body was too\n",
      "broad to get through it without further difficulty. In his present mood, it\n",

      "that Gregor would have enough space to get through. He was merely fixed on the\n",
      "idea that Gregor should be got back into his room as quickly as possible. Nor\n",
      "would he ever have allowed Gregor the time to get himself upright as\n",
      "preparation for getting through the doorway. What he did, making more noise\n",

      "But he had the impression that some hurried steps and the sound of the door\n",
      "leading into the front room being carefully shut had woken him. The light from\n",
      "the electric street lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceiling and tops\n",
      "of the furniture, but down below, where Gregor was, it was dark. He pushed\n",
      "himself over to the door, feeling his way clumsily with his antennae—of\n",
      "which he was now beginning to learn the value—in order to see what had\n",
      "been happening there. The whole of his left side seemed like one, painfully\n",
      "stretched scar, and he limped badly on his two rows of legs. One of the legs\n",
      "had been badly injured in the events of that morning—it was nearly a\n",
      "miracle that only one of them had been—and dragged along lifelessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it actually was\n",
      "that had drawn him over to it; it was the smell of something to eat. By the\n",
      "door there was a dish filled with sweetened milk with little pieces of white\n",
      "bread floating in it. He was so pleased he almost laughed, as he was even\n",
      "hungrier than he had been that morning, and immediately dipped his head into\n",
      "the milk, nearly covering his eyes with it. But he soon drew his head back\n",
      "again in disappointment; not only did the pain in his tender left side make it\n",
      "difficult to eat the food—he was only able to eat if his whole body\n",
      "worked together as a snuffling whole—but the milk did not taste at all\n",
      "nice. Milk like this was normally his favourite drink, and his sister had\n",
      "certainly left it there for him because of that, but he turned, almost against\n",

      "\n",
      "Through the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas had been lit in\n",
      "the living room. His father at this time would normally be sat with his evening\n",
      "paper, reading it out in a loud voice to Gregor’s mother, and sometimes\n",
      "to his sister, but there was now not a sound to be heard. Gregor’s sister\n",
      "would often write and tell him about this reading, but maybe his father had\n",
      "lost the habit in recent times. It was so quiet all around too, even though\n",
      "there must have been somebody in the flat. “What a quiet life it is the\n",
      "family lead”, said Gregor to himself, and, gazing into the darkness, felt\n",
      "a great pride that he was able to provide a life like that in such a nice home\n",
      "for his sister and parents. But what now, if all this peace and wealth and\n",
      "comfort should come to a horrible and frightening end? That was something that\n",
      "Gregor did not want to think about too much, so he started to move about,\n",
      "crawling up and down the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Once during that long evening, the door on one side of the room was opened very\n",
      "slightly and hurriedly closed again; later on the door on the other side did\n",
      "the same; it seemed that someone needed to enter the room but thought better of\n",
      "it. Gregor went and waited immediately by the door, resolved either to bring\n",
      "the timorous visitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who it\n",
      "was; but the door was opened no more that night and Gregor waited in vain. The\n",
      "previous morning while the doors were locked everyone had wanted to get in\n",
      "there to him, but now, now that he had opened up one of the doors and the other\n",
      "had clearly been unlocked some time during the day, no-one came, and the keys\n",
      "were in the other sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was put\n",
      "out, and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had stayed awake\n",
      "all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as they went away together\n",
      "on tip-toe. It was clear that no-one would come into Gregor’s room any\n",
      "more until morning; that gave him plenty of time to think undisturbed about how\n",
      "he would have to re-arrange his life. For some reason, the tall, empty room\n",
      "where he was forced to remain made him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the\n",
      "floor, even though he had been living in it for five years. Hardly aware of\n",
      "what he was doing other than a slight feeling of shame, he hurried under the\n",
      "couch. It pressed down on his back a little, and he was no longer able to lift\n",
      "his head, but he nonetheless felt immediately at ease and his only regret was\n",
      "that his body was too broad to get it all underneath.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He spent the whole night there. Some of the time he passed in a light sleep,\n",
      "although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of his hunger, and some of\n",
      "the time was spent in worries and vague hopes which, however, always led to the\n",
      "same conclusion: for the time being he must remain calm, he must show patience\n",
      "and the greatest consideration so that his family could bear the unpleasantness\n",
      "that he, in his present condition, was forced to impose on them.\n",

      "Gregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions, as early\n",
      "the next morning, almost before the night had ended, his sister, nearly fully\n",
      "dressed, opened the door from the front room and looked anxiously in. She did\n",
      "not see him straight away, but when she did notice him under the couch—he\n",
      "had to be somewhere, for God’s sake, he couldn’t have flown\n",
      "away—she was so shocked that she lost control of herself and slammed the\n",
      "door shut again from outside. But she seemed to regret her behaviour, as she\n",
      "opened the door again straight away and came in on tip-toe as if entering the\n",
      "room of someone seriously ill or even of a stranger. Gregor had pushed his head\n",
      "forward, right to the edge of the couch, and watched her. Would she notice that\n",
      "he had left the milk as it was, realise that it was not from any lack of hunger\n",
      "and bring him in some other food that was more suitable? If she didn’t do\n",
      "it herself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it, although he\n",
      "did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the couch, throw himself at\n",
      "his sister’s feet and beg her for something good to eat. However, his\n",
      "sister noticed the full dish immediately and looked at it and the few drops of\n",
      "milk splashed around it with some surprise. She immediately picked it\n",
      "up—using a rag, not her bare hands—and carried it out. Gregor was\n",
      "extremely curious as to what she would bring in its place, imagining the\n",
      "wildest possibilities, but he never could have guessed what his sister, in her\n",
      "goodness, actually did bring. In order to test his taste, she brought him a\n",
      "whole selection of things, all spread out on an old newspaper. There were old,\n",
      "half-rotten vegetables; bones from the evening meal, covered in white sauce\n",
      "that had gone hard; a few raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had\n",
      "declared inedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread with butter\n",
      "and salt. As well as all that she had poured some water into the dish, which\n",
      "had probably been permanently set aside for Gregor’s use, and placed it\n",
      "beside them. Then, out of consideration for Gregor’s feelings, as she\n",
      "knew that he would not eat in front of her, she hurried out again and even\n",
      "turned the key in the lock so that Gregor would know he could make things as\n",
      "comfortable for himself as he liked. Gregor’s little legs whirred, at\n",
      "last he could eat. What’s more, his injuries must already have completely\n",
      "healed as he found no difficulty in moving. This amazed him, as more than a\n",
      "month earlier he had cut his finger slightly with a knife, he thought of how\n",
      "his finger had still hurt the day before yesterday. “Am I less sensitive\n",
      "than I used to be, then?”, he thought, and was already sucking greedily\n",
      "at the cheese which had immediately, almost compellingly, attracted him much\n",
      "more than the other foods on the newspaper. Quickly one after another, his eyes\n",
      "watering with pleasure, he consumed the cheese, the vegetables and the sauce;\n",
      "the fresh foods, on the other hand, he didn’t like at all, and even\n",
      "dragged the things he did want to eat a little way away from them because he\n",
      "couldn’t stand the smell. Long after he had finished eating and lay\n",
      "lethargic in the same place, his sister slowly turned the key in the lock as a\n",
      "sign to him that he should withdraw. He was immediately startled, although he\n",
      "had been half asleep, and he hurried back under the couch. But he needed great\n",
      "self-control to stay there even for the short time that his sister was in the\n",
      "room, as eating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he could\n",
      "hardly breathe in that narrow space. Half suffocating, he watched with bulging\n",
      "eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up the left-overs,\n",
      "mixing them in with the food he had not even touched at all as if it could not\n",
      "be used any more. She quickly dropped it all into a bin, closed it with its\n",

      "had eaten their meal at midday as his parents would sleep for a little while\n",
      "then as well, and Gregor’s sister would send the maid away on some\n",
      "errand. Gregor’s father and mother certainly did not want him to starve\n",
      "either, but perhaps it would have been more than they could stand to have any\n",
      "more experience of his feeding than being told about it, and perhaps his sister\n",
      "wanted to spare them what distress she could as they were indeed suffering\n",

      "more answer than “no thanks, I’ve had enough” or something\n",
      "similar. No-one drank very much either. His sister would sometimes ask his\n",

      "Even before the first day had come to an end, his father had explained to\n",
      "Gregor’s mother and sister what their finances and prospects were. Now\n",
      "and then he stood up from the table and took some receipt or document from the\n",
      "little cash box he had saved from his business when it had collapsed five years\n",
      "earlier. Gregor heard how he opened the complicated lock and then closed it\n",
      "again after he had taken the item he wanted. What he heard his father say was\n",
      "some of the first good news that Gregor heard since he had first been\n",
      "incarcerated in his room. He had thought that nothing at all remained from his\n",
      "father’s business, at least he had never told him anything different, and\n",
      "Gregor had never asked him about it anyway. Their business misfortune had\n",
      "reduced the family to a state of total despair, and Gregor’s only concern\n",
      "at that time had been to arrange things so that they could all forget about it\n",
      "as quickly as possible. So then he started working especially hard, with a\n",
      "fiery vigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a travelling\n",
      "representative almost overnight, bringing with it the chance to earn money in\n",
      "quite different ways. Gregor converted his success at work straight into cash\n",
      "that he could lay on the table at home for the benefit of his astonished and\n",
      "delighted family. They had been good times and they had never come again, at\n",
      "least not with the same splendour, even though Gregor had later earned so much\n",
      "that he was in a position to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bear\n",
      "them. They had even got used to it, both Gregor and the family, they took the\n",
      "money with gratitude and he was glad to provide it, although there was no\n",
      "longer much warm affection given in return. Gregor only remained close to his\n",

      "violinist, it was his secret plan to send her to the conservatory next year\n",

      "some other way. During Gregor’s short periods in town, conversation with\n",
      "his sister would often turn to the conservatory but it was only ever mentioned\n",
      "as a lovely dream that could never be realised. Their parents did not like to\n",
      "hear this innocent talk, but Gregor thought about it quite hard and decided he\n",

      "when he simply became too tired to continue listening, when his head would fall\n",
      "wearily against the door and he would pull it up again with a start, as even\n",
      "the slightest noise he caused would be heard next door and they would all go\n",
      "silent. “What’s that he’s doing now”, his father would\n",

      "When explaining things, his father repeated himself several times, partly\n",
      "because it was a long time since he had been occupied with these matters\n",
      "himself and partly because Gregor’s mother did not understand everything\n",
      "the first time. From these repeated explanations Gregor learned, to his\n",
      "pleasure, that despite all their misfortunes there was still some money\n",
      "available from the old days. It was not a lot, but it had not been touched in\n",

      "using up all the money that Gregor had been bringing home every month, keeping\n",
      "only a little for himself, so that that, too, had been accumulating. Behind the\n",

      "and caution. He could actually have used this surplus money to reduce his\n",
      "father’s debt to his boss, and the day when he could have freed himself\n",

      "more. That’s to say, it was money that should not really be touched but\n",
      "set aside for emergencies; money to live on had to be earned. His father was\n",
      "healthy but old, and lacking in self confidence. During the five years that he\n",
      "had not been working—the first holiday in a life that had been full of\n",
      "strain and no success—he had put on a lot of weight and become very slow\n",
      "and clumsy. Would Gregor’s elderly mother now have to go and earn money?\n",
      "She suffered from asthma and it was a strain for her just to move about the\n",
      "home, every other day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the\n",

      "of seventeen, her life up till then had been very enviable, consisting of\n",
      "wearing nice clothes, sleeping late, helping out in the business, joining in\n",
      "with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing the violin. Whenever they\n",
      "began to talk of the need to earn money, Gregor would always first let go of\n",
      "the door and then throw himself onto the cool, leather sofa next to it, as he\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a wink but\n",
      "scratching at the leather for hours on end. Or he might go to all the effort of\n",
      "pushing a chair to the window, climbing up onto the sill and, propped up in the\n",
      "chair, leaning on the window to stare out of it. He had used to feel a great\n",
      "sense of freedom from doing this, but doing it now was obviously something more\n",
      "remembered than experienced, as what he actually saw in this way was becoming\n",
      "less distinct every day, even things that were quite near; he had used to curse\n",
      "the ever-present view of the hospital across the street, but now he could not\n",
      "see it at all, and if he had not known that he lived in Charlottenstrasse,\n",
      "which was a quiet street despite being in the middle of the city, he could have\n",
      "thought that he was looking out the window at a barren waste where the grey sky\n",
      "and the grey earth mingled inseparably. His observant sister only needed to\n",
      "notice the chair twice before she would always push it back to its exact\n",

      "pretend there was nothing burdensome about it, and the longer it went on, of\n",
      "course, the better she was able to do so, but as time went by Gregor was also\n",
      "able to see through it all so much better. It had even become very unpleasant\n",
      "for him, now, whenever she entered the room. No sooner had she come in than she\n",
      "would quickly close the door as a precaution so that no-one would have to\n",
      "suffer the view into Gregor’s room, then she would go straight to the\n",
      "window and pull it hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating. Even if it\n",
      "was cold, she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little while. She\n",
      "would alarm Gregor twice a day with this running about and noise making; he\n",
      "would stay under the couch shivering the whole while, knowing full well that\n",
      "she would certainly have liked to spare him this ordeal, but it was impossible\n",

      "One day, about a month after Gregor’s transformation when his sister no\n",
      "longer had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance, she came into\n",

      "window, motionless, and just where he would be most horrible. In itself, his\n",
      "sister’s not coming into the room would have been no surprise for Gregor\n",
      "as it would have been difficult for her to immediately open the window while he\n",
      "was still there, but not only did she not come in, she went straight back and\n",
      "closed the door behind her, a stranger would have thought he had threatened her\n",
      "and tried to bite her. Gregor went straight to hide himself under the couch, of\n",
      "course, but he had to wait until midday before his sister came back and she\n",
      "seemed much more uneasy than usual. It made him realise that she still found\n",
      "his appearance unbearable and would continue to do so, she probably even had to\n",
      "overcome the urge to flee when she saw the little bit of him that protruded\n",
      "from under the couch. One day, in order to spare her even this sight, he spent\n",
      "four hours carrying the bedsheet over to the couch on his back and arranged it\n",
      "so that he was completely covered and his sister would not be able to see him\n",
      "even if she bent down. If she did not think this sheet was necessary then all\n",
      "she had to do was take it off again, as it was clear enough that it was no\n",

      "it was. Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look of gratitude one time when he\n",

      "appreciated all the new work his sister was doing even though, before, they had\n",
      "seen her as a girl who was somewhat useless and frequently been annoyed with\n",
      "her. But now the two of them, father and mother, would often both wait outside\n",

      "looked, what Gregor had eaten, how he had behaved this time and whether,\n",
      "perhaps, any slight improvement could be seen. His mother also wanted to go in\n",
      "and visit Gregor relatively soon but his father and sister at first persuaded\n",
      "her against it. Gregor listened very closely to all this, and approved fully.\n",

      "about, it was hard to just lie quietly through the night, his food soon stopped\n",
      "giving him any pleasure at all, and so, to entertain himself, he got into the\n",
      "habit of crawling up and down the walls and ceiling. He was especially fond of\n",
      "hanging from the ceiling; it was quite different from lying on the floor; he\n",
      "could breathe more freely; his body had a light swing to it; and up there,\n",
      "relaxed and almost happy, it might happen that he would surprise even himself\n",
      "by letting go of the ceiling and landing on the floor with a crash. But now, of\n",

      "help from her father; the sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely since\n",
      "the cook had left but she certainly would not have helped in this, she had even\n",

      "fetch his mother to help her. As she approached the room, Gregor could hear his\n",
      "mother express her joy, but once at the door she went silent. First, of course,\n",
      "his sister came in and looked round to see that everything in the room was\n",
      "alright; and only then did she let her mother enter. Gregor had hurriedly\n",
      "pulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put more folds into it so that\n",
      "everything really looked as if it had just been thrown down by chance. Gregor\n",
      "also refrained, this time, from spying out from under the sheet; he gave up the\n",
      "chance to see his mother until later and was simply glad that she had come.\n",
      "“You can come in, he can’t be seen”, said his sister,\n",
      "obviously leading her in by the hand. The old chest of drawers was too heavy\n",

      "was, for one thing it was too heavy for them to get the job finished before\n",
      "Gregor’s father got home and leaving it in the middle of the room it\n",
      "would be in his way even more, and for another thing it wasn’t even sure\n",
      "that taking the furniture away would really be any help to him. She thought\n",
      "just the opposite; the sight of the bare walls saddened her right to her heart;\n",
      "and why wouldn’t Gregor feel the same way about it, he’d been used\n",
      "to this furniture in his room for a long time and it would make him feel\n",
      "abandoned to be in an empty room like that. Then, quietly, almost whispering as\n",
      "if wanting Gregor (whose whereabouts she did not know) to hear not even the\n",

      "during these two months, must have made him confused—he could think of no\n",
      "other way of explaining to himself why he had seriously wanted his room emptied\n",
      "out. Had he really wanted to transform his room into a cave, a warm room fitted\n",
      "out with the nice furniture he had inherited? That would have let him crawl\n",
      "around unimpeded in any direction, but it would also have let him quickly\n",
      "forget his past when he had still been human. He had come very close to\n",
      "forgetting, and it had only been the voice of his mother, unheard for so long,\n",
      "that had shaken him out of it. Nothing should be removed; everything had to\n",

      "and the desk, as she had thought at first, but all the furniture apart from the\n",
      "all-important couch. It was more than childish perversity, of course, or the\n",

      "just a few pieces of furniture being moved after all, but he soon had to admit\n",
      "that the women going to and fro, their little calls to each other, the scraping\n",
      "of the furniture on the floor, all these things made him feel as if he were\n",
      "being assailed from all sides. With his head and legs pulled in against him and\n",
      "his body pressed to the floor, he was forced to admit to himself that he could\n",
      "not stand all of this much longer. They were emptying his room out; taking away\n",
      "everything that was dear to him; they had already taken out the chest\n",
      "containing his fretsaw and other tools; now they threatened to remove the\n",

      "done his homework as a business trainee, at high school, even while he had been\n",
      "at infant school—he really could not wait any longer to see whether the\n",
      "two women’s intentions were good. He had nearly forgotten they were there\n",

      "So, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room catching\n",

      "it—of the lady dressed in copious fur. He hurried up onto the picture and\n",
      "pressed himself against its glass, it held him firmly and felt good on his hot\n",
      "belly. This picture at least, now totally covered by Gregor, would certainly be\n",

      "out.” “Just as I expected”, said his father, “just as I\n",

      "clear to Gregor that Grete had not said enough and that his father took it to\n",

      "violence. That meant Gregor would now have to try to calm his father, as he did\n",
      "not have the time to explain things to him even if that had been possible. So\n",
      "he fled to the door of his room and pressed himself against it so that his\n",

      "the best intentions and would go back into his room without delay, that it\n",

      "before. He really ought to have expected things to have changed, but still,\n",
      "still, was that really his father? The same tired man as used to be laying\n",

      "pushing back the bottom of his long uniform coat, and, with look of\n",
      "determination, walked towards Gregor. He probably did not even know himself\n",
      "what he had in mind, but nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high. Gregor was\n",
      "amazed at the enormous size of the soles of his boots, but wasted no time with\n",
      "that—he knew full well, right from the first day of his new life, that\n",

      "with fruit from the bowl on the sideboard and now, without even taking the time\n",
      "for careful aim, threw one apple after another. These little, red apples rolled\n",
      "about on the floor, knocking into each other as if they had electric motors. An\n",

      "steaming, and filled the room with its smell. The gentlemen bent over the\n",
      "dishes set in front of them as if they wanted to test the food before eating\n",
      "it, and the gentleman in the middle, who seemed to count as an authority for\n",
      "the other two, did indeed cut off a piece of meat while it was still in its\n",

      "whether it should be sent back to the kitchen. It was to his satisfaction, and\n",
      "Gregor’s mother and sister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to\n",
      "breathe again and smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The family themselves ate in the kitchen. Nonetheless, Gregor’s father\n",
      "came into the living room before he went into the kitchen, bowed once with his\n",
      "cap in his hand and did his round of the table. The gentlemen stood as one, and\n",
      "mumbled something into their beards. Then, once they were alone, they ate in\n",
      "near perfect silence. It seemed remarkable to Gregor that above all the various\n",
      "noises of eating their chewing teeth could still be heard, as if they had\n",
      "wanted to show Gregor that you need teeth in order to eat and it was not\n",
      "possible to perform anything with jaws that are toothless however nice they\n",
      "might be. “I’d like to eat something”, said Gregor anxiously,\n",
      "“but not anything like they’re eating. They do feed themselves. And\n",
      "here I am, dying!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having heard the violin\n",
      "being played, but this evening it began to be heard from the kitchen. The three\n",
      "gentlemen had already finished their meal, the one in the middle had produced a\n",
      "newspaper, given a page to each of the others, and now they leant back in their\n",
      "chairs reading them and smoking. When the violin began playing they became\n",
      "attentive, stood up and went on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway where\n",
      "they stood pressed against each other. Someone must have heard them in the\n",
      "kitchen, as Gregor’s father called out: “Is the playing perhaps\n",
      "unpleasant for the gentlemen? We can stop it straight away.” “On\n",
      "the contrary”, said the middle gentleman, “would the young lady not\n",
      "like to come in and play for us here in the room, where it is, after all, much\n",
      "more cosy and comfortable?” “Oh yes, we’d love to”,\n",
      "called back Gregor’s father as if he had been the violin player himself.\n",
      "The gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited. Gregor’s father soon\n",
      "appeared with the music stand, his mother with the music and his sister with\n",
      "the violin. She calmly prepared everything for her to begin playing; his\n",
      "parents, who had never rented a room out before and therefore showed an\n",
      "exaggerated courtesy towards the three gentlemen, did not even dare to sit on\n",
      "their own chairs; his father leant against the door with his right hand pushed\n",
      "in between two buttons on his uniform coat; his mother, though, was offered a\n",
      "seat by one of the gentlemen and sat—leaving the chair where the\n",
      "gentleman happened to have placed it—out of the way in a corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "His sister began to play; father and mother paid close attention, one on each\n",
      "side, to the movements of her hands. Drawn in by the playing, Gregor had dared\n",
      "to come forward a little and already had his head in the living room. Before,\n",
      "he had taken great pride in how considerate he was but now it hardly occurred\n",
      "to him that he had become so thoughtless about the others. What’s more,\n",
      "there was now all the more reason to keep himself hidden as he was covered in\n",
      "the dust that lay everywhere in his room and flew up at the slightest movement;\n",
      "he carried threads, hairs, and remains of food about on his back and sides; he\n",
      "was much too indifferent to everything now to lay on his back and wipe himself\n",
      "on the carpet like he had used to do several times a day. And despite this\n",
      "condition, he was not too shy to move forward a little onto the immaculate\n",
      "floor of the living room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "No-one noticed him, though. The family was totally preoccupied with the violin\n",
      "playing; at first, the three gentlemen had put their hands in their pockets and\n",
      "come up far too close behind the music stand to look at all the notes being\n",
      "played, and they must have disturbed Gregor’s sister, but soon, in\n",
      "contrast with the family, they withdrew back to the window with their heads\n",
      "sunk and talking to each other at half volume, and they stayed by the window\n",
      "while Gregor’s father observed them anxiously. It really now seemed very\n",
      "obvious that they had expected to hear some beautiful or entertaining violin\n",
      "playing but had been disappointed, that they had had enough of the whole\n",
      "performance and it was only now out of politeness that they allowed their peace\n",
      "to be disturbed. It was especially unnerving, the way they all blew the smoke\n",
      "from their cigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses. Yet Gregor’s\n",
      "sister was playing so beautifully. Her face was leant to one side, following\n",
      "the lines of music with a careful and melancholy expression. Gregor crawled a\n",
      "little further forward, keeping his head close to the ground so that he could\n",
      "meet her eyes if the chance came. Was he an animal if music could captivate him\n",
      "so? It seemed to him that he was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment\n",
      "he had been yearning for. He was determined to make his way forward to his\n",
      "sister and tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her\n",
      "violin, as no-one appreciated her playing here as much as he would. He never\n",
      "wanted to let her out of his room, not while he lived, anyway; his shocking\n",
      "appearance should, for once, be of some use to him; he wanted to be at every\n",
      "door of his room at once to hiss and spit at the attackers; his sister should\n",
      "not be forced to stay with him, though, but stay of her own free will; she\n",
      "would sit beside him on the couch with her ear bent down to him while he told\n",
      "her how he had always intended to send her to the conservatory, how he would\n",
      "have told everyone about it last Christmas—had Christmas really come and\n",
      "gone already?—if this misfortune hadn’t got in the way, and refuse\n",
      "to let anyone dissuade him from it. On hearing all this, his sister would break\n",
      "out in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her shoulder and kiss her\n",
      "neck, which, since she had been going out to work, she had kept free without\n",
      "any necklace or collar.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Samsa!”, shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor’s\n",
      "father, pointing, without wasting any more words, with his forefinger at Gregor\n",
      "as he slowly moved forward. The violin went silent, the middle of the three\n",
      "gentlemen first smiled at his two friends, shaking his head, and then looked\n",
      "back at Gregor. His father seemed to think it more important to calm the three\n",
      "gentlemen before driving Gregor out, even though they were not at all upset and\n",
      "seemed to think Gregor was more entertaining than the violin playing had been.\n",
      "He rushed up to them with his arms spread out and attempted to drive them back\n",
      "into their room at the same time as trying to block their view of Gregor with\n",
      "his body. Now they did become a little annoyed, and it was not clear whether it\n",
      "was his father’s behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning realisation\n",
      "that they had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room without knowing it.\n",
      "They asked Gregor’s father for explanations, raised their arms like he\n",
      "had, tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back towards their room only\n",
      "very slowly. Meanwhile Gregor’s sister had overcome the despair she had\n",
      "fallen into when her playing was suddenly interrupted. She had let her hands\n",
      "drop and let violin and bow hang limply for a while but continued to look at\n",
      "the music as if still playing, but then she suddenly pulled herself together,\n",
      "lay the instrument on her mother’s lap who still sat laboriously\n",
      "struggling for breath where she was, and ran into the next room which, under\n",
      "pressure from her father, the three gentlemen were more quickly moving toward.\n",
      "Under his sister’s experienced hand, the pillows and covers on the beds\n",
      "flew up and were put into order and she had already finished making the beds\n",
      "and slipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the room.\n",
      "Gregor’s father seemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he forgot\n",
      "all the respect he owed to his tenants. He urged them and pressed them until,\n",
      "when he was already at the door of the room, the middle of the three gentlemen\n",
      "shouted like thunder and stamped his foot and thereby brought Gregor’s\n",
      "father to a halt. “I declare here and now”, he said, raising his\n",
      "hand and glancing at Gregor’s mother and sister to gain their attention\n",
      "too, “that with regard to the repugnant conditions that prevail in this\n",
      "flat and with this family”—here he looked briefly but decisively at\n",
      "the floor—“I give immediate notice on my room. For the days that I\n",
      "have been living here I will, of course, pay nothing at all, on the contrary I\n",
      "will consider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damages from you,\n",
      "and believe me it would be very easy to set out the grounds for such an\n",
      "action.” He was silent and looked straight ahead as if waiting for\n",
      "something. And indeed, his two friends joined in with the words: “And we\n",
      "also give immediate notice.” With that, he took hold of the door handle\n",
      "and slammed the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gregor’s father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with his\n",
      "hands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himself out for his\n",
      "usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept nodding it could\n",
      "be seen that he was not sleeping at all. Throughout all this, Gregor had lain\n",
      "still where the three gentlemen had first seen him. His disappointment at the\n",
      "failure of his plan, and perhaps also because he was weak from hunger, made it\n",
      "impossible for him to move. He was sure that everyone would turn on him any\n",
      "moment, and he waited. He was not even startled out of this state when the\n",
      "violin on his mother’s lap fell from her trembling fingers and landed\n",
      "loudly on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Father, Mother”, said his sister, hitting the table with her hand\n",
      "as introduction, “we can’t carry on like this. Maybe you\n",
      "can’t see it, but I can. I don’t want to call this monster my\n",
      "brother, all I can say is: we have to try and get rid of it. We’ve done\n",
      "all that’s humanly possible to look after it and be patient, I\n",
      "don’t think anyone could accuse us of doing anything wrong.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“She’s absolutely right”, said Gregor’s father to\n",
      "himself. His mother, who still had not had time to catch her breath, began to\n",
      "cough dully, her hand held out in front of her and a deranged expression in her\n",
      "eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gregor’s sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her forehead.\n",
      "Her words seemed to give Gregor’s father some more definite ideas. He sat\n",
      "upright, played with his uniform cap between the plates left by the three\n",
      "gentlemen after their meal, and occasionally looked down at Gregor as he lay\n",
      "there immobile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have to try and get rid of it”, said Gregor’s sister, now\n",
      "speaking only to her father, as her mother was too occupied with coughing to\n",
      "listen, “it’ll be the death of both of you, I can see it coming. We\n",
      "can’t all work as hard as we have to and then come home to be tortured\n",
      "like this, we can’t endure it. I can’t endure it any more.”\n",
      "And she broke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down the face of her\n",
      "mother, and she wiped them away with mechanical hand movements.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“My child”, said her father with sympathy and obvious\n",
      "understanding, “what are we to do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "His sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessness and tears\n",
      "that had taken hold of her, displacing her earlier certainty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“If he could just understand us”, said his father almost as a\n",
      "question; his sister shook her hand vigorously through her tears as a sign that\n",
      "of that there was no question.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“If he could just understand us”, repeated Gregor’s father,\n",
      "closing his eyes in acceptance of his sister’s certainty that that was\n",
      "quite impossible, “then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement\n",
      "with him. But as it is ...”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s got to go”, shouted his sister, “that’s the\n",
      "only way, Father. You’ve got to get rid of the idea that that’s\n",
      "Gregor. We’ve only harmed ourselves by believing it for so long. How can\n",
      "that be Gregor? If it were Gregor he would have seen long ago that it’s\n",
      "not possible for human beings to live with an animal like that and he would\n",
      "have gone of his own free will. We wouldn’t have a brother any more,\n",
      "then, but we could carry on with our lives and remember him with respect. As it\n",
      "is this animal is persecuting us, it’s driven out our tenants, it\n",
      "obviously wants to take over the whole flat and force us to sleep on the\n",
      "streets. Father, look, just look”, she suddenly screamed,\n",
      "“he’s starting again!” In her alarm, which was totally beyond\n",
      "Gregor’s comprehension, his sister even abandoned his mother as she\n",
      "pushed herself vigorously out of her chair as if more willing to sacrifice her\n",
      "own mother than stay anywhere near Gregor. She rushed over to behind her\n",
      "father, who had become excited merely because she was and stood up half raising\n",
      "his hands in front of Gregor’s sister as if to protect her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all his sister.\n",
      "All he had done was begin to turn round so that he could go back into his room,\n",
      "although that was in itself quite startling as his pain-wracked condition meant\n",
      "that turning round required a great deal of effort and he was using his head to\n",
      "help himself do it, repeatedly raising it and striking it against the floor. He\n",
      "stopped and looked round. They seemed to have realised his good intention and\n",
      "had only been alarmed briefly. Now they all looked at him in unhappy silence.\n",
      "His mother lay in her chair with her legs stretched out and pressed against\n",
      "each other, her eyes nearly closed with exhaustion; his sister sat next to his\n",
      "father with her arms around his neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Maybe now they’ll let me turn round”, thought Gregor and\n",
      "went back to work. He could not help panting loudly with the effort and had\n",
      "sometimes to stop and take a rest. No-one was making him rush any more,\n",
      "everything was left up to him. As soon as he had finally finished turning round\n",
      "he began to move straight ahead. He was amazed at the great distance that\n",
      "separated him from his room, and could not understand how he had covered that\n",
      "distance in his weak state a little while before and almost without noticing\n",
      "it. He concentrated on crawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that\n",
      "there was not a word, not any cry, from his family to distract him. He did not\n",
      "turn his head until he had reached the doorway. He did not turn it all the way\n",
      "round as he felt his neck becoming stiff, but it was nonetheless enough to see\n",
      "that nothing behind him had changed, only his sister had stood up. With his\n",
      "last glance he saw that his mother had now fallen completely asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut, bolted and\n",
      "locked. The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled him that his little legs\n",
      "collapsed under him. It was his sister who had been in so much of a rush. She\n",
      "had been standing there waiting and sprung forward lightly, Gregor had not\n",
      "heard her coming at all, and as she turned the key in the lock she said loudly\n",
      "to her parents “At last!”.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What now, then?”, Gregor asked himself as he looked round in the\n",
      "darkness. He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move at all. This\n",
      "was no surprise to him, it seemed rather that being able to actually move\n",
      "around on those spindly little legs until then was unnatural. He also felt\n",
      "relatively comfortable. It is true that his entire body was aching, but the\n",
      "pain seemed to be slowly getting weaker and weaker and would finally disappear\n",
      "altogether. He could already hardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the\n",
      "inflamed area around it, which was entirely covered in white dust. He thought\n",
      "back of his family with emotion and love. If it was possible, he felt that he\n",
      "must go away even more strongly than his sister. He remained in this state of\n",
      "empty and peaceful rumination until he heard the clock tower strike three in\n",
      "the morning. He watched as it slowly began to get light everywhere outside the\n",
      "window too. Then, without his willing it, his head sank down completely, and\n",
      "his last breath flowed weakly from his nostrils.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When the cleaner came in early in the morning—they’d often asked\n",
      "her not to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in her hurry she\n",
      "still did, so that everyone in the flat knew when she’d arrived and from\n",
      "then on it was impossible to sleep in peace—she made her usual brief look\n",
      "in on Gregor and at first found nothing special. She thought he was laying\n",
      "there so still on purpose, playing the martyr; she attributed all possible\n",
      "understanding to him. She happened to be holding the long broom in her hand, so\n",
      "she tried to tickle Gregor with it from the doorway. When she had no success\n",
      "with that she tried to make a nuisance of herself and poked at him a little,\n",
      "and only when she found she could shove him across the floor with no resistance\n",
      "at all did she start to pay attention. She soon realised what had really\n",
      "happened, opened her eyes wide, whistled to herself, but did not waste time to\n",
      "yank open the bedroom doors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms:\n",
      "“Come and ’ave a look at this, it’s dead, just lying there,\n",
      "stone dead!”\n",
      "\n",

      "Mr. and Mrs. Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and had to make an\n",
      "effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before they could grasp what\n",
      "she was saying. But then, each from his own side, they hurried out of bed. Mr.\n",
      "Samsa threw the blanket over his shoulders, Mrs. Samsa just came out in her\n",
      "nightdress; and that is how they went into Gregor’s room. On the way they\n",
      "opened the door to the living room where Grete had been sleeping since the\n",
      "three gentlemen had moved in; she was fully dressed as if she had never been\n",
      "asleep, and the paleness of her face seemed to confirm this.\n",
      "“Dead?”, asked Mrs. Samsa, looking at the charwoman enquiringly,\n",
      "even though she could have checked for herself and could have known it even\n",
      "without checking. “That’s what I said”, replied the cleaner,\n",
      "and to prove it she gave Gregor’s body another shove with the broom,\n",
      "sending it sideways across the floor. Mrs. Samsa made a movement as if she\n",
      "wanted to hold back the broom, but did not complete it. “Now then”,\n",
      "said Mr. Samsa, “let’s give thanks to God for that”. He\n",
      "crossed himself, and the three women followed his example. Grete, who had not\n",
      "taken her eyes from the corpse, said: “Just look how thin he was. He\n",
      "didn’t eat anything for so long. The food came out again just the same as\n",
      "when it went in”. Gregor’s body was indeed completely dried up and\n",
      "flat, they had not seen it until then, but now he was not lifted up on his\n",
      "little legs, nor did he do anything to make them look away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Grete, come with us in here for a little while”, said Mrs. Samsa\n",
      "with a pained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom but not\n",
      "without looking back at the body. The cleaner shut the door and opened the\n",
      "window wide. Although it was still early in the morning the fresh air had\n",
      "something of warmth mixed in with it. It was already the end of March, after\n",
      "all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in amazement for\n",
      "their breakfasts; they had been forgotten about. “Where is our\n",
      "breakfast?”, the middle gentleman asked the cleaner irritably. She just\n",
      "put her finger on her lips and made a quick and silent sign to the men that\n",
      "they might like to come into Gregor’s room. They did so, and stood around\n",
      "Gregor’s corpse with their hands in the pockets of their well-worn coats.\n",
      "It was now quite light in the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the door of the bedroom opened and Mr. Samsa appeared in his uniform with\n",
      "his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other. All of them had been crying\n",
      "a little; Grete now and then pressed her face against her father’s arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Leave my home. Now!”, said Mr. Samsa, indicating the door and\n",
      "without letting the women from him. “What do you mean?”, asked the\n",
      "middle of the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and he smiled sweetly. The\n",
      "other two held their hands behind their backs and continually rubbed them\n",
      "together in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which could only end in\n",
      "their favour. “I mean just what I said”, answered Mr. Samsa, and,\n",
      "with his two companions, went in a straight line towards the man. At first, he\n",
      "stood there still, looking at the ground as if the contents of his head were\n",
      "rearranging themselves into new positions. “Alright, we’ll go\n",
      "then”, he said, and looked up at Mr. Samsa as if he had been suddenly\n",
      "overcome with humility and wanted permission again from Mr. Samsa for his\n",
