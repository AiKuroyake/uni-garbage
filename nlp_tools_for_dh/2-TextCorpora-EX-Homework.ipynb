    "In the 2-gram list above, we see lots of uninformative bigrams where the other member is a special character. One common preprocessing step in NLP is to clean the data. There isn't a perfect way to clean the data, since every project finds a bit different features of data irrelevant. For example, some projects may want to keep numbers in their data and some not. \n",

    "a) Clean the variable `all_summaries` from numbers and special characters (keep spaces), and save it to a new variable `all_summaries_cleaned`. There are many ways to do this. For example, you can iterate over every character of the string and check if the character is alphabet or space. Or then you can use regular expressions. Google and read about the options!
