In a statement, the Espoo-based telecoms company said it intended to ""reset its cost base,"" aiming to make savings of around 600 million euros by the end of 2023.
The company said that the cuts would offset investments in research and development focused on areas including 5G and cloud computing. The development could mean a net increase of jobs in Finland as the company continues to hire experts to work on its 5G technology.
Nokia currently employs around 90,000 people worldwide.
""Decisions that may have a potential impact on our employees are never taken lightly. Ensuring we have the right setup and capabilities is a necessary step to deliver sustainable long-term performance. My priority is to ensure that everyone impacted is supported through this process,"" said company CEO Pekka Lundmark in a statement.
Despite a 6 percent drop in sales, Nokia reported increased profits last year. The company made 918 million euros in 2020, up from 485 million in 2019."

These are some of the things bulking out the meals being provided to high school students in the southeastern city of Kotka while they study remotely.
The change follows feedback after the first week of remote schooling, which suggested that the meals were lacking both in portion size and side dishes.
Parents raised concerns over the nutritional value of the meals, commenting in the local ""Puskaradio Kotka"" group on Facebook.
""A few people have praised the decision. Some said it was great that we reacted so quickly,"" said Kari Turkia, CEO of Kymijoki Food Services which is contracted to provide school meals in Kymenlaakso.
On Monday, vegetarian students in Kotka received a pot of spaghetti with beans. Yle weighed the portion and found it weighed around 400 grams, some 100 grams more than a similar portion weighed the week before.
Schoolchildren could also pick up a packet of crispbread, spread and a whole cucumber, which count as a week's worth of side dishes.

Municipalities scrambled to provide food to remote learning school children as most parts of the country entered a three-week period of heightened coronavirus restrictions, starting 8 March.
Parents in Vantaa also raised concerns about the meals available there.
""Based on these packages, you can see the level of school food in Vantaa is inferior,"" commented one parent online, according to Helsingin Sanomat.
But local authorities defended the food packages, saying that they were forced to act quickly.
""When information about [the transition to] distance learning came, we had to arrange everything at short notice,"" Vantaa's Director of Basic Education Ilkka Kalo told HS.
According to Kotka's Kymijoki Food Services, some dishes are difficult to obtain quickly because such a large proportion of the country's school students are now distance learning.
Distance learning measures currently in place in most areas are due to expire on 28 March.

According to police statistics, the city said, there were 19 quarantine violations during the months of January and February, compared to 21 such breaches during all of last year.
The city said that because police usually discover individuals are breaking quarantine orders during the course of other duties, there were likely to be more violations than were reported.
People breaking quarantine can face fines or up to three months of jail time, even if they do not infect anyone else.
""Avoiding social encounters is the way we can most effectively prevent coronavirus from spreading. The virus variants are more contagious than the previous strain. Therefore, everyone must take the situation very seriously and reduce contact with others to a minimum,"" the city's basic security director, Sanna Svahn, said in a statement.
Svahn recommended that over the coming weeks, residents should only meet people from their own households.
""If you've been exposed to the virus and you have received quarantine orders, it is an absolute must: you cannot meet anyone other than those living in the same household,"" Svahn emphasised.
The city's statement on the matter noted that Espoo's coronavirus case rate was rising. It said as of Tuesday, the number of new cases per 100,000 residents was around 298, compared to 250 a week earlier.
Espoo Mayor Jukka Mäkelä also chimed in on the subject.
""We are fighting coronavirus together, and cooperation has gone well in Espoo. Measures only work when they're followed. This is especially true about quarantines,"" he said in a statement."

""According to the prosecutor, there are clear similarities in the case to Koskela in Helsinki,"" the tabloid writes. ""The young people took videos and pictures of the violence,"" it continues.
The case, which began at Päijät-Häme district court on Monday, concerns alleged acts of violence against three victims, aged 13 at the time, carried out by other school-age children. The alleged incidents are said to have occurred two years ago and not on school grounds, the paper reports.
The story comes after a citizens' initiative to make school bullying a criminal offence in its own right collected the required 50,000 signatures for it to be presented to Parliament for consideration.
In December Interior Minister Maria Ohisalo (Green) said the government was preparing an initiative aimed at tackling youth marginalisation and bullying.
How quickly can we vaccinate everyone?
Daily Helsingin Sanomat looks at an alternative plan that it says could see every adult in Finland receive a single dose of the coronavirus vaccine by June.
The paper says data models suggest that by giving all adults a single dose, authorities could achieve a ""good"" level of resistance to the virus across the country.
As HS puts it, ""it would be better to give good protection to everyone than excellent protection to some.""
The paper's numbers are based on an estimate from the Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) which assumes Finland will take delivery of 5.5 million doses of the vaccine by June this year.
The newspaper estimates that there are 1.8 million people aged over 70 or in high-risk groups who require a total of 3.6 million doses to be protected, which should be done by May, the paper says. After that, the remaining 1.9 million working age people could in theory all be given a single dose, after which a second round could begin.
""Thinking about it, it could probably be a way to increase the number of people protected, if the quantity of vaccines available in Finland is much less than promised,"" THL's Hanna Nohynek told the paper.
Oulu dumpsite sparks criticism
Oulu-based Kaleva covers an environmental story about an area of marshland in the northern city which has been used for disposing of excess soil.
Pyyryväissuo, a bog north-east of Oulu, was classified as an endangered habitat, Kaleva writes.
""The city has stated that endangered habitats will not be degraded and this activity is contrary to the city's own line,"" chair of the Oulu branch of the Finnish Association for Nature Conservation Inka Karvonen told the paper.
But Oulu city's surveyor Kaija Puhakka defended the decision, telling Kaleva that city authorities made an assessment that took into account the area's natural value but also the environmental impact of transporting the waste.
""Oulu is a growing city and in certain situations we have to go to so-called virgin areas,"" Puhakka said.
In 2020 Oulu designated the city's Sanginjoki forest as a protected area, in one of the city's biggest ever conservation moves.
""We believe that Oulu's forest nature conservation decisions compensate for the decisions that have to be made in different parts of the city, due to the city's natural growth,"" Puhakka told Kaleva."

Half of Finland's share of a nearly three-billion-euro Recovery and Resilience Facility will go towards helping the country make a ""green transition"" from reliance on fossil fuels while one-quarter of the funding will be used towards digitalisation, according to the Minsitry of Finance.
According to current estimates--and pending Parliamentary approval of the arrangement--Finland is to receive a total of around 2.9 billion euros out of the EU's 750 billion euro stimulus package over the next few years.
According to the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change, Krista Mikkonen (Green), the green transition funding would be the largest single climate investment that Finland has ever made.
Meanwhile, funding will help to increase funding in research, development and innovation by around 700 million euros, the government said.
In total, Finland can receive about 3 billion in grants. The country's contribution to the package will be around 6.6 billion euros during the years 2028-2058.
Reforms and development
Minister of Finance, Matti Vanhanen, who presented Finland's Sustainable Growth Programme plans at a press conference on Monday, said the focus of the investments have more to do with reform than crisis recovery.
""The government's programme for sustainable development aims for many positive effects for both the environment and people. Emissions will be reduced, our competitiveness and everyday life will improve throughout the country,"" Vahanen said.
According to estimates presented by Vanhanen, the green transition funding would help the country reduce its annual greenhouse gas emissions by three million tonnes, or roughly six percent of its emissions.
The finance minister said that the stimulus package would also help to increase Finland's GDP by half a percentage point during 2021-2023, adding that investments made possible by the package would mobilise more than three billion euros towards private investments.
Still needs approval
Finnish Parliament has not yet approved the stimulus package plans. Last month, Prime Minister Sanna Marin's (SDP) government won a confidence vote over the recovery package plans, a motion tabled by some opposition parties.
The Finns Party, Christian Democrats and Movement Now said at the time it was not in the country's best interest to take part in the stimulus package.
Like other EU states, Finland is facing an EU deadline at the end of April to present plans on how plans to use the funds. EU countries will jointly approve the plans of each member state.
The EU Commission has urged Finland and many other countries to focus on fewer but more effective projects.
The EU has said just over a third of the recovery funds should be used toward curbing climate change and that no money could be spent on efforts that were detrimental to climate goals.
The Finnish government noted that while the preliminary total of the EU's Recovery and Resilience Facility would be approximately 2.1 billion euros during 2021-2023, the actual final sum would not be known until the summer of 2022. It said the figure would be affected by the performance of the economy during this and next year.
Plans could still change
There are plans to invest in digital technologies, for example within the rail transport sector, which ""will enable more efficient use of rail capacity, reduce disruption and improve safety,"" according to a finance ministry statement issued Monday.
The programme will also help to bring high-speed internet connectivity to areas which do not receive such service, according to the ministry.
""The plan as currently presented can still be changed. The government aims to make it as effective as possible and to work transparently and in consultation with the different stakeholders. We welcome feedback and comments on the detailed programme now published,"" Vanhanen said in the ministry statement."

It's a similar situation nationwide.
In Helsinki people often try to make vaccination appointments ahead of time, while the majority of calls to the appointment booking service in Kainuu come from individuals not yet eligible for the jabs.
Yle gathered some of the most common questions people ask when calling the vaccination appointment lines and put them to two experts, Sirkku Kaltakari, service manager at Oulu Social and Health Services, and infectious diseases doctor Jarkko Huusko.
Here are their answers:
1. How do I know if it's my turn to get the vaccine?
Vaccinations are given according to a nationally-agreed schedule. The website of the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) contains information on the order of vaccinations by age and risk groups.
If you can't find the information you need there, you can call your own health centre.
Story continues after the image.

2. How was the vaccination schedule decided?
The schedule was decided by the National Advisory Committee on Vaccines (KRAR), which is appointed by THL and is being strictly followed.
Age is the most significant risk factor for coronavirus, which is why the elderly are being vaccinated first.
3. I booked an appointment online. How do I know if it worked?
You don't need to confirm an appointment you booked online by calling. In Oulu, for example, you can choose to receive a confirmation by email when you book your time slot.
4. Can I get the brand of vaccine I want?
For now, it is not possible to choose which brand of coronavirus vaccine you will receive.
A number of different coronavirus vaccines have been approved for use by the European Medicines Agency. Jarkko Riikonen / Yle
5. Can a carer get vaccinated at the same time as the person they care for? 
Carers living in the same household as the person they care for can be vaccinated. The appointment for both the care giver and care receiver can be reserved at the same time. People receiving regular care at home and their carers will receive the vaccine via their home care service.
6. Can you get vaccinated if you've already had the coronavirus? What about other illnesses or medical treatments? 
If you've had the coronavirus you can still get the vaccine, but there's no rush to get vaccinated. It's currently thought that recovering from the illness provides protection from new infection for up to six months.
Suffering from an infectious disease is a reason to delay vaccination. You can only get vaccinated when you're healthy and have recovered from the infection.
After receiving chemotherapy it's a good idea to let your body recover for a few days so your immune system can respond to the vaccine. High-dose cortisone treatment is also a barrier to getting vaccinated.
7. Can the vaccine give you coronavirus?
No it can't.
The vaccine may cause mild and brief symptoms near the injection site in some patients. General symptoms can include hot flushes, redness, swelling, pain or swelling of the lymph nodes.
Some people might also experience mild general symptoms like tiredness, feeling unwell or having a temperature, according to the experts."

Nearly as many respondents said they also trusted the country's official research bodies, such as the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL).
Confidence levels tended to increase in tandem with respondents' education levels, according to the survey.
When the respondents were divided politically, supporters of the Social Democratic Party, the National Coalition Party and the Green League tended to trust the data and information from public entities, while Finns Party voters tended to be most critical of such research findings, the survey found.
The country's weather forecasters received a great deal of trust among respondents, with more than four-out-of-five saying they trusted local weather forecasts completely or to some extent.
Meanwhile, a majority of respondents said they trusted economic forecasts and business barometers (around 65 percent) and party support surveys (60 percent).
Trust in this sort of data tended to increase with a respondent's age, although a greater proportion of university graduates, business executives and entrepreneurs also trusted it, according to the foundation.
The survey found the lowest levels of trust and confidence in horoscopes (8 percent) and megatrends (49 percent) which are used to predict future changes to society.
Horoscopes saw the most trust (18 percent) from people under the age of 30 and members of SAK, the Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions (16 percent).
The foundation's survey was carried out in November and December 2020 and queried more than 1,000 residents in Finland aged 18-79. The margin of error was fewer than three percentage points in either direction."

Unifi, the organisation that represents Finland's universities, said plans for the examinations had been ""drawn up taking into account the prevailing pandemic situation and the necessary safety arrangements.""
""We have estimated that conducting physical entrance examinations is the best way to ensure the fairness of student admissions in these circumstances. We have prepared carefully for the process and are confident that the entrance examinations can be carried out with thoroughly considered safety arrangements,"" said Petri Suomala, who chairs Unifi’s meetings for vice-presidents for education.
Programmes that have already announced they will hold entrance examinations remotely will carry those exams out as planned. Entrance examinations for arts subjects will be held both remotely and in person, Unifi said.
No leeway for sick students
In safety instructions jointly prepared by Finnish universities, this year's applicants are recommended to limit social contact for a period of two weeks before sitting their exams. Applicants must also maintain two metre safety distances and wear masks while at examination sites.
Applicants in quarantine or self-quarantine on exam day would not be able to take the tests, Unifi said. Special arrangements for those in isolation, including remote examinations or sitting the exam on a different day would not be possible, the organisation said.
""By carefully reviewing both the entrance examination instructions and the general coronavirus guidelines by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) in advance, applicants will ensure that the examination situation goes smoothly and the risk of infection can be minimised,"" Suomala said.
Last year's cohort of university applicants were largely admitted via remote exams taken at home or on the basis of their matriculation exam results.
The sudden shift led to complaints to the parliamentary ombudsman after some students were told they would have to sit admissions exams with only a few days' notice.
82,000 exam spots for universities of applied sciences applicants
Entrance tests for universities of applied sciences are due to take place between 31 May and 9 June. There are 82,000 places available for applicants to sit the tests in 25 locations nationwide.
Applicants will be able to choose a test site closer to home in order to minimise travel.
""Examination places are available in Kajaani, Joensuu, Lahti, Lappeenranta, Kemi, Rovaniemi, Helsinki, Oulu, Pori, Kuopio, Seinäjoki, Jyväskylä, Tampere, Turku, Vaasa, Kouvola, Kotka, Savonlinna, Mikkeli, Raseborg, Hämeenlinna, Ylivieska and Pieksämäki,"" said Executive Director Petri Lempinen from Arene, the organisation representing universities of applied sciences in Finland.
For the first time, the standardised entrance exam for universities of applied sciences will include a section on emotional intelligence, to be completed by applicants to social care, health, sports and beauty care programmes, as well as those applying to humanities and education subjects."

Minister of Employment Tuula Haatainen (SDP) said the business community's desire for the country to streamline and expedite work-related immigration application processes were justified.
""At the same time, the attitudes of Finnish society continue to make it more difficult for those who have already moved to the country to find employment,"" Haatainen said at a press conference on Monday morning.
The minister noted that people with an immigrant-background name receive far fewer invitations to job interviews, even if their education, work experience and language skills are the same as those of other applicants.
Haatainen criticised employers in both the public and private sectors over this issue.
""The government's efforts to attract international specialists will be futile if attitudes prevent the use of their knowledge and expertise,"" Haatainen said, as she set out the measures that will be taken to promote work-based immigration.

Streamlining residence permit process
There is still too much bureaucracy involved with the processing of work and education-based residence permits, Haatainen said.
The current government had promised that by the end of its term of office, the average processing time for work and education-based residence permits will be 30 days.
However, according to the ministry, there is no easy way to streamline the residence permit process, but there is room for improvement in both legislation and official procedures. The ministry's proposed amendments to the law are scheduled to be brought to Parliament for consideration later this year.
""The acceleration of work- and education-based processes will promote Finland's chances in global competition for specialists, as well as the internationalisation of business and innovation activities and the attracting of investment to Finland,"" the ministry's statement read.
The ministry has set out a number of objectives aimed at attracting international specialists to Finland, which have been included in the Talent Boost programme (external link).
Fast track for startup entrepreneurs
In addition to streamlining the residence permit processes in general, the government plans to create a new fast lane for international specialists, startup entrepreneurs and their family members.
In this fast track, a decision on an electronic residence permit application is promised within 14 days of sending and paying for the application online.
The ministry plans to pilot this project later this year, if the technology required can be put in place.
Target specialists from New Delhi, Silicon Valley
The Ministry also announced that it is preparing two recruitment pilot projects aimed at attracting specialists and startup entrepreneurs to Finland from Silicon Valley in the United States and New Delhi in India.
Companies participating in the pilots are promised support for international recruitment.
""As part of the recruitment pilots, a first-stage pilot of the fast lane will also be carried out, in which specialists and startup entrepreneurs and their family members will be given a service promise of two weeks for the processing of residence permits,"" the ministry stated, adding that Finland's attractiveness among high-skilled international specialists has been relatively low so far.

Haatainen said that these pilot projects will only begin to gain momentum once the coronavirus epidemic has subsided.
""It has been assessed that safety and a functioning society, which have already been identified as Finland's attractions, will be further emphasised in the post-coronavirus era,"" Haatainen said at the Monday morning press conference.
Diversity programme
The ministry further revealed plans to introduce a programme aimed at highlighting and promoting diversity within the Finnish workplace.
""The programme will include services that strengthen diversity and internationalisation of working life through business and employer services,"" the release stated. ""Diversity benefits businesses. A company whose employees represent different ethnic groups and genders is also more financially viable.""
The aim of the programme is for companies and organisations to benefit from diversity and to make it easier for immigrants to access jobs that match their skills and to advance in their careers, the ministry added.
Tackling problems associated with work-based immigration
Haatainen also addressed some of the problems associated with work-based immigration, such as exploitation of foreign workers by Finnish employers.
""We should not be naive,"" Haatainen said. ""For the lower-skilled workforce, poor language skills combined with an over-reliance on the employer create an atmosphere and an opportunity for exploitation of employees.""
Story continues after the photo.
Yle reported on the widespread exploitation of foreign construction workers in Finland in September.Silja Viitala / Yle                                                          
Last December, the government proposed making amendments to the Aliens Act that would help to prevent the exploitation of foreign workers more effectively.
On Monday, the ministry stated that most foreigners applying for a job in Finland have little or no knowledge of the rules of the Finnish labour market.
For this reason, information for foreign workers will be offered at foreign embassies when a visa or residence permit is issued. In addition, further details will also be provided about who to contact if there are problems with the employer.
""Work-based immigration will only be sustainable if we follow the rules of the Finnish labour market. That is why we have included measures to combat the above-mentioned side effects,"" Haatainen said.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment sets out the reasons why the government is taking action to address these issues.
""The number of working-age people in Finland is decreasing and population growth is taking place exclusively through immigration. Without adequate immigration, Finland's labour supply and employment will fall substantially in the longer term, with implications for the dependency ratio, the employment rate and the sustainability gap,"" the ministry said.
Finland has already identified a shortage of specialists in the IT sector, healthcare and construction.
""In 2019, we lost about 65,000 jobs due to a shortage of specialists,"" Haatainen explained. ""If jobs are not created, Finland will not be able to fully develop."""

""Based on the thorough studies and calculations, the overall cost of the investment is significantly lower in Rotterdam. Our decision relies on ensuring our future competitiveness and our renewables’ growth strategy execution,"" Neste CEO Peter Vanacker said in a statement.
Earlier in March, a report in business paper Kauppalehti suggested that establishing the new refinery in Rotterdam would be up to 500 million euros cheaper than in Porvoo.
Neste already has a biorefinery plant in Rotterdam, which means that locating the facility there will mean expanding existing infrastructure.
The decision goes against the wishes of Prime Minister Sanna Marin (SDP), who had previously said the government would ""leave no stone unturned"" in efforts to secure Neste's investment in Finland.
It also follows a decision to close the company's Naantali refinery in November last year, at the cost of 370 jobs.

The initiative, launched last October, took off after reports emerged of the alleged murder of a 16-year-old by three teenagers in the Koskela district of Helsinki last December.
A preliminary investigation by police found that the victim had been subjected a prolonged period of bullying, while an Yle investigation found that social services and schools missed opportunities to protect the 16 year-old before he was killed.
The organisers of the initiative believe that legislative change is required to tackle mental and physical violence within schools.
""When enshrined in law, those working with children and young people would have a clear and unambiguous duty to intervene and take matters forward,"" the initiative’s statement reads, adding that the term ‘school bullying’ hides the reality, such as the malicious spreading of gossip or physical violence.
In the 'adult world', the statement says, such acts could be considered defamation or aggravated assault.
It adds further that the term school bullying does not take into account the far-reaching effects of physical and mental violence at school, and it does not give a true picture of bullying as an extremely serious threat to the health of children and young people.
The initiative also emphasises the need for preventive action and the importance of schools tackling the root causes of bullying."

HS's question is prompted by National Coalition Party mayoral candidate Juhana Vartiainen, who the paper quotes as saying ""the cities that will be successful in the future are those that attract young people and immigrants.""
It's a topic that has gained ground in recent years as Finland's birth rate has fallen. In December last year it was reported that Finland had the lowest birth rate in the Nordic countries.
So, what is immigration worth to Helsinki? ""There is no simple answer,"" Matti Sarvimäki, Assistant Professor of Economics at Aalto University told the paper.
In Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa and Kaunianen, incoming people with a native language other than Finnish, Swedish or Sámi accounted for 70 percent of population growth between 2015 and 2019.
According to Aalto University's Matti Sarvimäki, newcomers do not really compete with Finnish residents for jobs. ""The majority of the native population has different skills than newcomers. The concern that immigrants would take a lot of jobs from the native population is not justified, "" he tells HS.
On the other hand, ""high unemployment among immigrants is a big issue,"" Senior Research Fellow Pasi Saukkonen from the Helsinki City Information Unit tells the paper.
According to Saukkonen, refugees are among those who have the most difficulty finding work, as they often lack the training and language skills the Finnish job market requires.
Overall, HS finds that Finland is worse at employing foreign-born people than other Nordic countries, with an employment rate of 60 percent, compared to the 65-68 percent seen in Sweden, Denmark and Norway.
Third wave blues
Tampere-based Aamulehti turns its attention to the so-called ""third wave"" of coronavirus now sweeping Europe, which it says is largely the result of new variants of the virus.
The paper quotes THL Chief Physician Taneli Puumalainen, who says that ""in several countries, including Finland, the disease situation has turned more difficult again.""
For much of the pandemic Finland had performed well, with some of the lowest rates of infection in Europe. Now, that status as a ""model country"" no longer applies, the paper says.
According to Aamulehti, the development of the third wave has been ""worrying."" The paper reserves extra concern for the situation in Estonia, where the infection rate is now the second-highest in the continent and around nine times higher than it is in Finland.
Aamulehti quotes HUS physician Asko Järvinen, who says that Estonia's infection rate has had a negative impact in the Helsinki area – itself home to the highest infection rate in the country.
Coronavirus conscripts
Daily tabloid Iltalehti reports on an outbreak of coronavirus affecting the Pori Brigade of the Finnish Defence Forces.
The paper reports that conscripts are feeling ""corona fatigue"" after two infection clusters at garrisons in Niinisalo and Säkylä led to many being placed in isolation.
""The information here is really bad. I have no idea what's going on, no one says anything,"" one quarantined conscript tells the paper.
Iltalehti's report also alleges that quarantined conscripts do not have access to the shower facilities or changes of clothes. ""As far as I know, people who've been exposed [to the coronavirus] are not allowed to use the shower,"" one garrison member said.
The paper alleges that one conscript interviewed on Sunday had not been able to wash since the previous Thursday. Responding to the claim, the Pori Brigade's Brigadier General Mika Kalliomaa tells the paper that in their case an error had occurred.
""All servicemen should shower daily,"" he said."

She will be presented with the award on 17 September at the 65th International Festival of Contemporary Music at Venice's historic Teatro La Fenice.
The opening day of the festival will be dedicated to honouring Saariaho, a ground-breaking electro-acoustic composer who has lived in France for nearly four decades.
The prize committee noted that Saariaho is one of the world's most widely performed contemporary composers. In a statement on Friday, it said that her music ""has the gift of power and immediacy and generates original acoustic tapestries and unprecedented sonic narrations”.
The jury said that Saariaho is being honoured in particular for her 1999 work Oltra Mar, calling it ""an absolute masterpiece…a harmonically complex but transparent composition, and a synthesis of unusual metamorphic orchestral colours influenced by Impressionism”.
Oltra Mar will receive its Italian premiere on the opening day of the festival, when it will be performed by the Teatro la Fenice choir and orchestra conducted by Spanish conductor Ernest Martinez-Isquierdo.
The committee praised Saariahofor ""the remarkable technical and expressive level she has achieved in her choral scores and for her original use of the voice”.
Rated ""greatest contemporary composer"" in 2019
Since 1982, Saariaho has lived in Paris, where she has been closely associated with the Institute for Research and Coordination in Acoustics/Music (IRCAM).
Saariaho has previously won numerous other music awards, including a Grammy Award in 2011 for her opera L'amour de loin, the Polar Music Prize in 2013 and the Nordic Council Music Prize in 2000. Saariaho was ranked as the greatest contemporary composer in a 2019 poll by BBC Music Magazine.
Interviewed by Yle in December, Saariaho was sharply critical of Finnish officials' decisions to cancel concerts and festivals to slow the spread of coronavirus while allowing restaurants, bars and other sectors to keep operating."

The Eastern Uusimaa Rescue Service began collecting oil from the harbour on Sunday. It predicted that the process would take several days as it was attached to ice floes, which must be mechanically removed from the water.
Officials said the oil spill appeared to be limited to the area around a tanker docked in the port. The leak was detected around 3 pm on Saturday when cargo was being unloaded from the ship.

In addition to Neste's own tugs and boats, Border Guard boats were on hand.
Border Guard oil spill response vessels may be requested at the scene later, says Tomi Nurmivaara of the Eastern Uusimaa Rescue Service, who was overseeing the operation.
Neste: Not oil from tanker's cargo
The source of the leak was still being sought, but according to Jori Sahlsten, Neste's production director for oil products, the type of oil in the water is different from that stored in the visiting tanker moored in the port.
Sahlsten said he expects that the oil in the water can be collected, as the area is limited and close to the ship.
""If it were on the open sea, it would probably be more difficult. It's likely that it can be contained in the immediate vicinity of the pier, so it should be possible to collect it very precisely,"" he told Yle.
“The amount is still difficult to estimate, but it doesn’t seem to be very large based on the area [visible] in the immediate vicinity of the ship,” Sahlsten added.
Neste, which is about 36 percent state-owned, is one of Finland's biggest exporters. It bills itself as ""the world’s largest producer of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel refined from waste and residues"".
It recently announced the closure of its other Finnish refinery in Naantali, and plans to build a new one, likely in Rotterdam."

More than 70 percent of people in Finland over the age of 80 have received at least the first dose of vaccine, according to the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL).
In Helsinki, the uptake among people over the age of 85 is around 97.3 percent, said Leena Turpeinen, Director of Health and Substance Abuse Services at the City of Helsinki.
According to Turpeinen, the city has actively tried to reach residents who are eligible for the vaccine but have not booked an injection time.
Markku Broas, chief physician for infectious diseases at the Lapland Hospital District, estimates that in Lapland between 80 and 90 percent of people over age 80 have received at least the first shot.
Reasons for not taking vaccine vary
According to Hanna Nohynek, head of the vaccine unit at the THL, some people fail to show up for their vaccination appointments, but the reasons may be quite more mundane.
""Often people do not come for vaccinations if they are ill or the weather is bad. For example, icy drizzle can be especially difficult for elderly people if they have to go to a health centre to get the vaccine,"" Nohynek said.
Attitudes towards coronavirus vaccines have become more positive, according to the state-commissioned 'Citizens' Pulse' survey carried out regularly by Statistics Finland.
In December 48 percent of respondents said they would certainly agree to take the coronavirus vaccine. By the end of February, the figure had risen to 66 percent.
Now, 80 percent of people over the age of 60 say they would definitely take the vaccine.
Adults under the age of 30 seem to be the most sceptical about the vaccine. Just 49 percent said they would certainly get the jab, while 27 percent said they would not or were unsure.
Regional disparities have evened out
Vaccination rates have evened out across the country, and regional disparities are no longer as large as in February.
""Regional differences were due to the fact that vaccines were sent in proportion to the number of healthcare professionals working with coronavirus and nursing homes. These, of course, vary by region. There are also some differences in geographical distances; that is, as vaccines arrive and as they come, may vary. And shipments of the Pfizer vaccine, for example, are dictated by cold chain and packaging requirements,"" Nohynek said.
In the autonomous Åland Islands and in sparsely-populated Lapland, vaccinations have been rapid since the beginning.
In Åland and East Savo, 15.1 percent of all age groups have already been vaccinated, while in Lapland, northern Finland, the figure is 13.8 percent.
In the Helsinki and Uusimaa hospital district, which has had by far the highest infection rate, 9.6 percent had been vaccinated as of Sunday.
Nohynek said some of the variations are due to the small size of some municipalities, which have received enough vaccine to distribute to all eligible residents. She noted that the Pfizer vaccine, for example, is delivered in packs of about 1,000 doses.
Broas said that in Lapland, co-ordination between municipalities has contributed to the high inoculation rate.
""A slightly larger amount of the Moderna vaccine came to Lapland than to the rest of the country, because distances are long here,"" Broas told Yle. The reason for this is that the Moderna vaccine has longer shelf life than other vaccines.
Changes in vaccination priorities under consideration
Between April to June, Finland expects to receive an average of 450,000 doses of vaccine per week.
According to a previous THL estimate, vaccinations for non-at-risk adults could begin in late June or early July. If more vaccines are available, this could come earlier.
No decision has yet been made about changing the priority sequence of vaccinations, but the matter is being considered, Nohynek said. The government will consider who should be vaccinated after people over the age of 70 and those in risk groups have been inoculated.
In an interview with Yle earlier this month, THL Director General Markku Tervahauta suggested that 'vaccine buses' could be send to neighbourhoods with large immigrant populations or the prioritisation of certain areas that have higher infection rates.
""The matter is being considered and preparations are being made so that once the over-70s and other risk groups have been vaccinated, there will be sufficient guidance to fine-tune the program,"" said Nohynek.
As of Sunday, 10.8 percent of the population nationwide had received at least one vaccination dose. That number is up by one third in the past 10 days.
Only about 1.5 percent have received both shots, though. That share has not risen significantly in the past month.
The THL estimates that 70 percent coverage, which it considers the minimum level for herd immunity, will at the current pace be reached around 22 September."

New exchange students have not generally been allowed to come to Finland since last autumn, but some of those in the country have been linked to a string of Covid-19 clusters.
In January, 150 students attended a party at a bar in Jyväskylä, with more than 100 of them later being diagnosed with Covid infections. In Helsinki, at least 100 were exposed to or contracted coronavirus infections at a party in February. In Lappeenranta, infections appeared after a spa trip, with more than a dozen exchange students falling ill. In Tampere, at least 26 people became ill in an infection chain involving exchange students.

In the most recent case, at least 20 exchange students from Kuopio were infected after participating in a ski trip to Saariselkä in Finnish Lapland. The University of Eastern Finland said in its press release that students had been repeatedly urged not to go on the trip.
The cases have attracted attention, but exchange students are no less responsible than others, say student organisation representatives.
""I wouldn't generalise. Certainly, there are many different kinds of people among exchange students, as among native Finns,"" said Sanna Heinonen, Secretary General of the University of Eastern Finland's Student Union.
Heinonen does not believe that cultural differences have played a major role in the choices made by exchange students.
Organisations fill informational gaps
Student organisations say they make every effort to ensure that information about restrictions and recommendations is available to international students.
The Student Union of the University of Eastern Finland has tried to provide as much information as possible about coronavirus in English for the benefit of international students.
The university itself said in a press release that it had repeatedly urged students not to travel.
According to Konstantin Kouzmitchev, a board member responsible for international affairs at the National Union of University Students in Finland (SYL), there is plenty of room for improvement in terms of information. Schools and cities have not always provided comprehensive information in languages other than Finnish, he said.
""At times, NGOs have taken over the authorities' duties when information has not been sufficiently accessible,"" Kouzmitchev said.
The Erasmus Student Network (ESN) is one of Finland's largest organisers of international student events. The local ESN group in Kuopio was originally involved in organising the ill-fated Saariselkä trip.
However, ESN backed out of the trip in early February, recommended that participants not go and offered them refunds for cancellations.
According to ESN National Board President Toni Tamminen, unclear restrictions and recommendations have confused exchange students.
""We have received a lot of feedback about the fact that university facilities are closed while bars have been allowed to remain open. This has caused confusion,"" said Tamminen, a medical student in Kuopio.
How seriously should Finnish recommendations be taken?
Some exchange students also come from countries that have experienced full lockdowns unlike any so far in Finland. It can sometimes be difficult for them to figure out how seriously Finnish recommendations should be taken. Some say it seems strange that for instance bars are open, but that the public is urged not to go to them.
""We have tried to emphasise that recommendations are as important as restrictions,"" Tamminen said.
SYL says that student organisations have generally been responsible regarding events.
""Student communities and organisations have cancelled a huge number of events. There have been no official student events,"" said Kouzmitchev.
However, the union's power is limited: private companies cannot be barred from organising trips or events, nor can anyone be forced to stay home.
""Of course, we have expressed the hope that people would not be encouraged to go on group trips like this. But everyone has their own responsibility and freedom as to how they spend their free time,"" said Heinonen.
International students more prone to loneliness
Student organisation leaders point out that exchange students are struck particularly hard by isolation as they usually lack family, friends and safety nets in Finland.
""I really feel bad for them. Of course, they want to get to know this new country, its culture and student life,"" said Heinonen.
""The vast majority of exchange students have complied with restrictions, switched to distance learning and faced challenges in their mental health,"" said Kouzmitchev."

As of Saturday, all passengers on Helsinki regional public transport (HSL) must wear face masks. The only exceptions are children under the age of 12 and people who cannot wear masks due to medical conditions. No certificate is required to prove such health issues, though.
HSL estimates that about eight of 10 passengers had already been wearing masks before the new rule. It has recommended their use since last August.
A mask requirement also took effect on Saturday on public transport in the southeastern city of Imatra.
Turku and Tampere follow suit, but not Oulu
On Monday, similar rules take effect on Tampere's Nysse and Turku's Föli regional transport services. The Turku area now has the worst infection situation outside of the Helsinki region, with more than 100 new cases reported on Saturday.
Föli operates in Turku, Kaarina, Raisio, Naantali, Lieto and Rusko, while Nysse runs in Tampere, Kangasala, Lempäälä, Nokia, Orivesi, Pirkkala, Vesilahti and Ylöjärvi.
""The coronavirus situation is now so worrying that all means must be adopted,"" Tampere Mayor Lauri Lyly said on Friday.
Nysse says that the cleaning of buses has been stepped up, and that all doors are always opened at every stop to ensure good ventilation. The mask mandate also applies to trial runs of the city's new tramway.
Other local operators say they plan to also introduce such requirements.
Oulu public transport in northern Finland has recommended face mask use since last August but has not announced such a requirement.

""We do not yet have legislation in place, but it is being prepared. Many questions remain open,"" the premier said on the current affairs programme Ykkösaamu.
Restrictions on movement would only be imposed if there is a significant worsening of the pandemic situation and an overburdening of healthcare and infection tracing services, she said, adding that restrictive measures must be necessary, proportionate and effective.
She said that the government is particularly keeping an eye on the situation in the greater Helsinki and Turku regions.
Individual restrictions, such as requiring appointments to visit shops, as in some parts of Germany, are not in the offing, she said.
No general mask requirement on the way
""If these variants of the virus spread at a rapid pace and people do not voluntarily reduce their contacts, then we must be able to address all these contacts very widely, not only at shopping malls and individual companies, but also in people's social contacts,"" she said.
That would mean restrictions on movement, Marin said.
According to Marin, no general mask requirement is on the way, because there would not be enough resources to enforce it.
The PM also commented on the order in which coronavirus vaccines are being administered, saying the priorities may be reconsidered once people in high-risk groups have been inoculated.
""The next step is to consider whether vaccines should be concentrated in the areas most affected by the epidemic, for example, or whether people in certain occupational groups should be vaccinated,"" she said."

The current unofficial record held by an unidentified person is currently 30 Covid-19 tests over the past year. The district's statistics showed that there were more than 650 Finns who have been tested more than ten times.
A similar trend was also observed at Finland's largest laboratory firm, Fimlab, which tests and analyses samples in the regions of Pirkanmaa, Central Finland, Kanta-Häme, Ostrobothnia and Päijät-Häme.
The lab noted a clear increase in coronavirus tests after the conclusion of recent school winter holidays, with up to 2,000 Covid samples analysed daily in the Pirkanmaa region.
Several reasons
According to Anu Mustila, Fimlab's Service Director, the main reason people have sought tests was due to an increase in infections. People want to protect their loved ones and to know whether they need to quarantine.
""In our view, people have been very active in terms of getting tested, especially now that the number of infections has clearly increased,"" Mustila said.
Meanwhile, HUS' Järvinen said he hopes another reason for the increase in tests was a general realisation about how easy it is to get tested, and drive-in tests making the process even easier.
""You can book the test time yourself, and you will get a response quickly on your phone. The process has been made to be as easy as possible,"" he said.
A possible third reason for the increase in testing that asymptomatic individuals who have been exposed to the virus are also being tested now.
""Those who have been exposed to the British virus variant but are asymptomatic have been tested twice, which is reflected in the numbers,"" Järvinen noted."

Prosecutors had asked for suspended jail sentences in the case.
The court did hand down guilty verdicts for former head of Helsinki police Jukka Riikonen and Aarnio himself, along with one of his subordinates.
Aarnio was not sentenced, as the court viewed his multiple other jail terms as sufficient punishment, but the other two were fined by the court.
Helsinki District court had previously acquitted all those accused because they had been unable to register informants properly, but the prosecutor appealed that verdict.

According to Tuominen, those living in areas with a higher incidence of the virus should be included in the at-risk groups.
According to Tuominen, Finland and Uusimaa in particular have areas and socio-economic groups among which infection and mortality rates have been higher throughout the pandemic. Tuominen says he believes it is precisely because of these risks that the vaccination order should be revised.
Coronavirus infection rates especially high in Northern and Eastern Helsinki, in areas such as Itäkeskus and Vuosaari, as well as parts of Espoo, according to Tuominen.
""Coronavirus Infections are over-represented in the non-Finnish-speaking and non-Swedish-speaking populations,"" said Tuominen. ""The common feature in many of the infection cases are high-density living conditions, lower income levels and larger family sizes.""
Postcode lottery
The chief executive of HUS said he would consider whether certain postcode areas should be next in line in the vaccination order after the elderly have been vaccinated, and before the vaccine is rolled out to the rest of the general population.
Tuominen suggested that coronavirus vaccine could be targeted to postcodes where infections have been high for a long time, compared to other areas.
The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) is responsible for prioritisation of vaccines. Tuominen hopes THL will evaluate the prioritisation of the vaccines based on the risk of illness and death.
""THL should consider what the optimal way to administer the vaccines would be. I don’t want to give them detailed instructions, but when it comes to areas or groups of people that will be vaccinated, there should be a difference. Some should be vaccinated earlier,"" the HUS boss said.
""Risk group categorisations can be added to, and one risk factor is also where a person lives, and in what kind of environment they live in. On the risk scale, I would rate this risk as being very high. I think it is dangerous if the risk-evaluation is not made now, and if the reasons for doing or not doing something are not recorded,"" Tuominen stated.
Other vaccines already targeted in high-incidence areas
Tuominen points out that screenings and some other vaccines, such as the so-called 'tick vaccine' are already targeted to those who live in high-risk areas.
The Finnish national vaccination programme offers a free TBE (tick-borne encephalitis) vaccine to everyone over the age of three who has a permanent home or holiday house in areas where the risk of getting infected is higher.
""In the case of the coronavirus vaccines, we also have to look specifically at who is at the highest risk of getting ill and dying. It is not equality that everyone born on the same day receives the vaccine at the same time. Equality is that risks are evaluated.""
""I think this debate needs to take place now. It will be unfortunate if in six months or one year's time, we realise that some areas or population groups have carried a heavier burden of the disease,"" he concluded."

The hearing started on Friday, with prosecutors stating that the accused stabbed the victim to death on 12 June 2020.
The victim died within minutes after receiving three stab wounds. Prosecutors say the attacker intended to kill the victim, and are demanding a prison sentence.
The accused has admitted his guilt.
When first reported, the case was the focus of disquiet from transgender groups as police misgendered the victim when they first announced it.
Trans activists said the police statements and media coverage of the case had been offensive.
Ilta-Sanomat was the first media to report the case, and it said the victim had been a man even though trans organisations had confirmed from multiple sources that the victim had lived as a woman for several years.
The court documents do not take a stand on the victim's gender, but use her legal name. Trans groups said last summer that the victim's legal gender was male because of Finland's poor legal provision for the recognition of transgender identities.

They are updated every year with new themes and slightly varying contents.
This year the box contains 50 items, a few less than last year due to customers' environmental concerns, according to the agency.
As far as designs, Kela said it tried to fulfil requests for clothes that can be easily mixed and matched.

The garments are neutrally-coloured featuring illustrations of nature scenes and wildlife.
For the first time, expectant parents have been able to influence the design of the baby sleeping bag. After more than 1,300 votes, the winning design featured illustrated seals and puffins on a muted grey background of mountains.

One variation on this year's collection was the inclusion of a silicone bucket bib, in addition to a more traditional one.

The box that holds the items can also be used as a baby's first bed. This year the box is decorated in creamy blue hues and entitled ""Blueberry Milk."" It was created by designer Ilona Partanen. The design was one of the winners of the maternity box design competition held in 2017 and the colourful pattern was used last year, as well.

Kela adjusting boxes' carbon footprint
An opinion survey about maternity boxes carried out in 2020 found that expectant box recipients would be willing to receive fewer items if it meant the whole package would be environmentally friendlier.
This year's box contains six fewer items than it did in 2020, and does not include items like a cotton coverall, blanket or thermometer, for example.
However, new parents may not start receiving the newly-outfitted box right away, as new ones are distributed only after supplies of previous versions run out.
Finland's new baby starter kit tradition began more than 80 years ago.
The benefits agency noted that expectant parents who want to receive the box should apply (Kela link) at least two months in advance of the baby's estimated delivery date."

The Association of Editors, Finland's union for media bosses, has asked for more openness about proposals to invoke powers to centralise communications, saying that preparation of legislative proposals should be transparent even during a state of emergency.
The proposal is currently going through the parliamentary process before it comes into force, and the government has apparently asked ministries for comments on the proposals without making that public.
Then on Thursday it appeared that Finland's medicines agency was reluctant to comment on possible problems with the AstraZeneca vaccine because it wasn't sure how clauses related to communications worked.
The national news agency STT reported that reluctance, before it became clear that the government is not planning to invoke provisions that would ban official bodies outside the Prime Minister's office from making public statements.
In any case, the emergency powers intended to expedite effective communication had in fact had the opposite effect — at least initially.
Discrimination fight
Helsingin Sanomat carries an opinion piece from the non-discrimination ombudsman who says that it is currently too difficult for victims of discrimination to claim compensation.
The legal process is complex and expensive, and the tribunal system takes a long time, writes the ombudsman.
That lengthy process means that victims can miss the two-year deadline for claiming compensation — which must be done separately.
The piece cites research showing that some ethnic groups in Finland have to send many times more applications, even with identical qualifications and experience, to get an interview.

Non-alcoholic Alko
Helsingin Sanomat also covers Alko's sales figures from last month, which showed a 10.2 percent increase year-on-year.
Much of that increase was made up of hard alcohol, over which the state-owned chain has a monopoly. But in its press release the company stressed a rise in sales of non-alcoholic drinks.
Young people, says Alko, are increasingly 'sober curious' and willing to try mocktails and other non-inebriating tipples.
Last year the firm says it sold some 571,000 litres of non-alcoholic drinks, which Alko says is nearly enough for one glass each for every resident of Finland.
The vast majority of Alko profits still come from alcohol sales.
School meal nightmares
As Finland ends the first of three weeks of partial shutdown, Ilta-Sanomat has a visual representation of what some school kids are getting for their midday meals.
Grades 7-9 and upper secondary level pupils are remote learning in many parts of the country, and that means they get food parcels from the local authority to provide sustenance during the school day.
Inevitably, the quality varies. Social media has been ablaze with miserable pictures of porridge boxes and sad-looking vegetables, but there are also some municipalities that provide a varied and nutritious package for their young people.
Check out the pictures here."

Finnish Parliament's Chancellery Commision said the reason for Savola's dismissal was his initial denial that he had leaked security camera footage of an alleged assault on MP Juha Sipilä outside parliament in early January. However the following month, Savola admitted passing the video to media.
The incident took place on 7 January when a passerby approached Sipilä as he was crossing the street near the Parliament building. Police located the suspect during the course of the preliminary investigation but have been unable to determine a motive behind the alleged attack.
The footage was published by commercial broadcaster MTV, and appeared to show the suspect following Sipilä after an exchange of words, and pushing him from behind.
Probe revealed source
Following a Parliamentary investigation into how the footage ended up in the hands of a news outlet, Savola later confirmed in a report that he had handed the material over to the media. He explained that several media outlets had asked to see footage of the incident from the surveillance camera recordings.
He justified releasing the footage saying it was photographed in a public place, and that its disclosure did not endanger Parliament's security protocols.
Savoloa told Yle on Thursday that he will review Parliament's dismissal notice, adding that he would likely appeal the decision.
When the video footage first emerged online, Parliamentary Secretary-General Maija-Leena Paavola said that the surveillance camera footage was, in principle, confidential material and that the Parliamentary Office wanted to determine ""how it was possible"" that the material was released to the media.
At the time, Paavola told Yle that she considered the release of the footage to be ""exceptional."""

The infected individuals went to the Saariselkä ski resort in late February, in a group of 46 exchange students from the University of Eastern Finland's Kuopio campus.
The city of Kuopio's infectious diseases chief, Raija Savolainen, said that it was difficult to say where the infection chain began but noted there were suspicions that it may have originated in Saariselkä.
She said none of the group's members had suspected they had infections before they embarked on the trip and that about 10 individuals began showing coronavirus symptoms after they returned to Kuopio.
The group was in Saariselkä from 28 February to 4 March, on a trip organised by tourism outfit Timetravels, Savolainen said.
""They had their own accommodation and were accompanied by a tour operator guide who organised various activities,"" Savolainen explained.
'Not the time for group trips'
Markku Broas, Chief Physician of Infectious Diseases of the Lapland Hospital District, said that people should not be taking group vacations right now.
""Now is not the time for group trips. The risk of infection in southern Finland is so great that the risk of coronavirus spreading during trips is significant. The guidance and recommendations are that all travel, unless absolutely necessary, should be avoided right now,"" Broas said.
Local health authorities in Lapland reported four new coronavirus infections in the region on Thursday, two of which were diagnosed in the northern municipality of Kolari, near the Swedish border.
Broas said those two cases were found to be linked to the Kuopio group."

Officials have postponed local elections over Covid concerns, but primary schools remain open. APN askedAndersson if Finland has done enough to keep schools safe, as it has not introduced mass testing.
""Testing in schools [in Finland] to date has not changed our picture of the situation so far,"" she told APN.
With many pupils in the country learning remotely this school year, Andersson said the divide between different socio-economic groups was growing.
""The issue we have had to tackle is the lack of support for learning that you see in many families,"" she explained.
Finland often claims it wants to attract people from abroad, so APN asked Andersson if the education system was prepared to welcome international families. Schools regularly place native English-speaking children in beginners' English classes with Finnish kids.
On this point Andersson urged schools to work with families to find a better solution. ""It doesn't sound very useful to put native speakers in beginners' classes,"" the minister said.

The man was cleared of all charges and freed on Thursday.
The district court pointed out that the charges against the man were largely based on circumstantial evidence. It noted that there is substantial evidence that indirectly implies the defendant's guilt but does not directly prove it.
The District Court said it was very possible that the defendant had antipathies towards Kataja, but noted that others may have as well. The man, born in 1979, denied any involvement in the brutal assault.
Another suspect, former local Finns Party politician Teemu Torssonen, was previously released.
A fake package apparently used as a pretext for gaining access to Kataja's home was found to bear fingerprints from Torssonen and the other suspect, who is a friend and political supporter of Torssonen's.
In 2018-19, Kataja played a key role in a process whereby Torssonen was first barred from running as a Finns Party parliamentary candidate and then expelled from the party.
He had been elected to Jyväskylä city council on the Finns Party ticket in 2017, and remains on the council as an independent.
Case remains unresolved
The court said it is clear that last summer's attack by two men took place as Kataja reported, and that the act likely had a political motive. Kataja suffered a fractured skull among other serious injuries, which could have been life-threatening.
Traffic cameras appeared to capture images of a white car speeding away from Kataja's house in Jämsänkoski, central Finland, after the attack last July, but the vehicle has not been identified.
The case now remains unresolved, with no other suspects.
There has not been a case of politically motivated attempted murder in Finland in nearly a century, since the days of the nationalist Lapua Movement in the 1930s."

The terminal's final design is still in progress, but building work is expected to start as early as May this year. The terminal, which will also include facilities for Customs and Border Guard officials, will be built on the site of an old storage facility in the city's harbour.
If construction goes ahead as planned, the facility will be ready for use by next spring, according to traffic operations director at the Port of Hamina-Kotka, Ville Kuitunen, who said that the port wants to generate regular passenger traffic to St. Petersburg.

The Port has held preliminary talks with ferry operators interested in the route, but plans are still at an early stage, Kuitunen said.
""In spite of the coronavirus situation, discussions have taken place with certain parties. There is nothing locked in,"" he noted.
The port is also interested in possibly opening up a passenger ferry route to Estonia. Kuitunen said that ships from abroad could also use the new terminal.

International cruise ships began stopping in Kotka in 2017, but all such traffic came to a halt last year due to the coronavirus crisis.
In spite of the pandemic, the ports of Kotka and Hamina are expected to see lively passenger traffic later this year, with ten cruise ships already scheduled to visit this season. The first is due to arrive at the end of June.
However, due to coronavirus-related restrictions, international ships are required to follow precise operating instructions as well as provide adequate levels of medical personnel and coronavirus testing capabilities.
International cruise passengers who want to visit the Kotka-Hamina area will not be permitted to move freely on city streets but instead will need to be part of guided tours.
Although Kotka and Hamina have very busy shipping ports, passenger traffic has been rare, as the few attempts at opening new passenger routes have been unsuccessful in recent decades.
Currently Finland's only passenger terminal providing service to St. Petersburg is located in Helsinki."

The ""exceptionally large"" action against de Wit was brought by 20 plaintiffs, among them police officers, prosecutors and a judge.
According to the prosecution, de Wit allegedly defamed the plaintiffs on his website Laitonlehti.net (roughly translated as ""illegal magazine""). In addition, de Wit is alleged to have published defamatory videos and texts elsewhere online. He denies the charges, although he does not dispute that the alleged defamatory statements exist.
Intended to 'incite hostility'
According to the prosecution, de Wit's publications included the accusations that officials were prejudiced, perjurers, imposters, unqualified for their jobs and criminals.
""De Wit's publications were also intended to incite hostility towards various groups of people, intensify social confrontation and unjustifiably undermine people's trust in the police and judicial authorities,"" the indictment said.
According to the prosecution, de Wit also suggested that the police officers belonged to an alleged pedophile ring, and were sympathetic to terrorists and the Islamisation of Finland.
De Wit has previously been handed down a suspended sentence for violently resisting an official in the performance of duties, two counts of insubordination against police officers, and obstructing an officer.
Defendant denies charges
Not all parties in the case filed for prosecution, but Attorney General Raija Toiviainen pushed for prosecution as a matter of very important public interest.
According to the prosecution, systematic pressure on officials creates a misconception that an official in public service should tolerate any form of insult, intimidation or abuse. The prosecutor is demanding de Wit receive a prison term of 8 to 10 months, or be ordered to carry out community service.
De Wit has denied the charges, arguing that while the existence of the publications themselves is not in dispute, the criticism is justified on the grounds that it is directed at the conduct of the plaintiffs in public office.
""I am absolutely innocent, and this [case] is revenge by politicised officials because the Laitonlehti website writes critically and very reasonably about the activities of these authorities,"" de Wit told Yle last October.
At the same time, he also denied writing in a vulgar manner, arguing that that calling police officers ""perverts"" and ""child sexual fantasists"" was a legitimate critique of the fact that uniformed police attended the Helsinki Pride parade."

""I've got to ask, where are you from?"" another patient asked her.
Jäske has lived in Finland all her life. All that time she has frequently had to prove that she really is Finnish, because she doesn't look like the traditional image of a Nordic person. The question came as a blow.
""It's frustrating. But to avoid an embarrassing situation and take the easy way out I once again told a complete stranger about my entire family background. My father is Finnish but my mother is from Taiwan,"" Jäske says.
After getting her leg put in plaster the nurse complemented Jäske on her surprisingly good Finnish. As she left the clinic, Jäske was offered help – in English – by a passerby.
""In a very short time, in a completely everyday situation, my ""Finnishness"" was questioned three times. I understand that these comments weren't meant to be offensive, but in my head it sounds as if there are ""us Finns"", and that I don't belong,"" says Jäske.
That series of events is just one example of the microaggressions that Jäske has encountered her whole life. Microaggressions – whether intentional or unintentional – are words or actions that communicate hostile, negative or derogatory attitudes towards a person or people.
Jäske says she is sharing her story to try and change the world.
""The concept of Finnishness should be expanded to accommodate more people who look different, and not just blonde-haired, blue-eyed Elovena girls,"" she says.
When praise isn't praise
This week is Anti-Racism and Discrimination Week. People tend to think of racism as being when someone does or says something racist to another person. But discrimination can take many forms.
Something that sounds innocent can mark someone out as different. If a person constantly hears that they are somehow wrong or anomalous, they gradually begin to believe it themselves.
That's what happened to Janina Ojala. As a girl, she felt a sense of shame and fear when her dad would tease her in Thai while they waited in line at the shop. Ojala hid from her friends the fact that her family ate with a fork and spoon at home, and not a knife and fork. She did her best to keep her Thai roots from attracting attention.
""Typically it's comments about how lovely and thick my hair is, or how quickly my skin tans. One comment is not a problem, but when you hear things like these on a daily basis they have a big impact on how you see yourself,"" Ojala explains.
Story continues after photo.

The kinds of comments Ojala describes are known as ""exoticisation"", comments that emphasise difference by attaching positive stereotypes to it. Ojala has lived in Finland her whole life, with her Finnish mother and Thai father.
""Although now I'm older I consider multiculturalism to be enriching, in certain situations I still feel the need to present myself a certain way to others,"" she says.
At university Ojala met others who had lived through similar experiences. With the support of her peers she finally felt able to embrace her Thai side. Now she wants to support others to do the same.
Together with Alice Jäske and Priska Niemi-Sampan, Ojala created ""Mixed Finns"", an Instagram account which aims to provide support and information about being a mixed-race Finn.
Does someone's appearance make them an immigrant?
As a child, Priska Niemi-Sampan felt just like the others, walking to school with her backpack on. Her family always spoke Finnish at home, even when they lived abroad due to her parent's job as an aid worker.
But Priska was an unusual name, and the looks she inherited from her Filipino father drew attention. Soon, she found herself constantly answering questions about her ""homeland"", about her language skills and her appearance. As far as society was concerned, the young girl was a foreigner.
""I felt for a long time that university wasn't a place for someone that looks like me. I wasn't encouraged to go by my school or my hobbies. The attitudes of the world around us have a huge impact on how a person sees their own potential,"" Niemi-Sampan says.
Priska Niemi-Sampan, 26, tried to avoid attention as a child, but now she wants to be a positive role model for others. Ronnie Holmberg / Yle
A recent article in the journal Sosiologia (link in Finnish) by Anna Rastas, a researcher from Tampere University who specialises in studying racism and fellow researcher Sanna Poelman, says that the conversation about racism and racial identity in Finland still revolves around immigration.
This is despite the fact that more and more Finnish people belong to ethnic minority groups.
There has been a concerted effort to eradicate racism in Finnish society since the time Niemi-Sampan was at school, but there is a still a lot of work to be done. In 2019 researchers at Helsinki University found job applicants with foreign-sounding names were less likely to be invited for job interviews than applicants with typically Finnish names.
Niemi-Sampan came across similar discrimination after going to university. She helped found the organisation Students of Colour which aims to stamp out racism in higher education. Now she wants to extend the support outside the world of academia.
""As a child I would have longed for support from my peers and now I want to offer young people a community where they can talk about these thoughts and feelings. Social media is a natural environment for reaching young people and sharing their experiences,"" she says.
In the future, Mixed Finns also hopes to offer anti-racism training for various organisations.
A world where national identity is more than skin deep 
Would Janina Ojala be able to speak Thai if she had dared practice it when she was a child? Would Priska Niemi-Sampan feel more self-confident if she hadn't spent her life trying to escape notice? Would Alice Jäske know more about her mother's culture if she hadn't felt pressured to hide her Taiwanese-ness when she was younger?
Mixed Finns's efforts may not change the world, but they represent a step towards a dream the three women share.
This dream is of a world where someone's Finnish identity isn't defined by the way they look, and where a person can belong to multiple cultures without being seen as an outsider to all of them.
The women also challenge Finns to think more carefully about what they say, because what seems like a compliment to one person might not always feel that way to another."

The health agency said Finland would continue to use the vaccine, despite that several countries have suspended its use due to concerns about blod clots in a small number of people who received the jab.
The THL said it was awaiting findings from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) about the vaccine's safety. So far, the EMA has not recommended discontinuing its use.
Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, EMA Executive Director Emer Cooke said the agency is continuing to evaluate the vaccine and consult with specialists, with a further announcement expected on Thursday.
Cooke added that she remains ""firmly convinced"" the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks.
""There is no indication vaccination has caused these [blood clotting] conditions,"" Cooke said.
Cooke noted that side effects likel blood clots were also not observed in clinical trials of the vaccine.
""We take the reports [of blood clots] very seriously. This is an ongoing process which requires a thorough and detailed analysis.
Cooke said the EMA would make an announcement about the investigation into the vaccine on Thursday, likely in the afternoon.
The EMA had previously said that as of 10 March, there were a total of 30 cases of patients with blood clots among the nearly five million individuals who had received the AstraZeneca jab within the EEA, according to news agency Reuters.
List of countries suspending use of AstraZeneca vaccine grows 
On Tuesday, health authorities in Sweden announced plans to pause its use, but it was unclear whether the suspension was temporary or permanent.
Several other countries, including Germany, France, the Netherlands and Italy have suspended its use over concerns of bleeding and blood clots in people who received the jab. Norway and Denmark also suspended use of the vaccine last week due to side effect concerns.
But as of Tuesday, global health officials from the World Health Organization (WHO) still supported using the AstraZeneca vaccine.
Health officials from the UN and EU are to meet this week about the matter, according to a UN bulletin. Meanwhile, it said that the WHO's Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety planned to discuss the issue with the EMA on Tuesday."

A pre-trial investigation by police uncovered evidence that 17 drug shipments from the Netherlands took place between mid-2018 and May of last year, involving drugs with an estimated street value of more than 20 million euros.
The list of defendants in the case includes citizens of Finland and of other countries, but two Dutch men, aged 44 and 47, are believed to be the main organisers of the operation.
Police suspect they established a company to import Dutch flowers and houseplants into Finland via the port of Vuosaari in eastern Helsinki. They then obtained drugs in the Netherlands which were packed and hidden among the legitimate cargo for transport to Finland.
Once in Finland, the drugs were usually dropped off at locations along the route when flowers and plants were delivered to stores, and then picked up by customers.
The cargo shipping company is not suspected of involvement in the alleged crimes.
International, professional operation
Police believe that the main customers were two separate criminal organisations based in the Helsinki region, one mostly made up of people from East Africa and the other mainly of people from the Middle East.
Criminal groups of foreign origin have taken over the drug trade in the capital region, Helsinki police say.
""These groups are united by either ethnic origin or by the same language. This story is a pretty good example of how drug trafficking and organised crime operates in the metropolitan area. It is truly international,"" Helsinki police department inspector Markku Heinikari told news agency STT, adding that the group’s activities are very ""professional and well-organised.""
""They are drug professionals. They have strong international connections with professional criminals in other countries,"" he said.
In addition to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) and the Helsinki police, the case was also investigated by police departments in Ostrobothnia, Häme and South-East Finland.
A Finnish citizen is suspected of having ordered several consignments of drugs from the Netherlands to Finland. The consignments were large and included a wide range of different illegal drugs including cocaine, amphetamines and ecstasy, investigating officers understand.
The suspect has no significant previous criminal background, police added.
The trial is expected to continue until the end of June."

An international jury selected four winners out of ten finalists at an awards ceremony that marked the end of the year-long challenge.
The competition attracted 252 proposals from teams based in 35 countries. The winning solutions all focused on the city's district heating system, which accounts for more than half of Helsinki's carbon emissions.
The city has committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2035.
Two of the winning concepts, HIVE and The Hot Heart, would use water from the Baltic sea as a source of carbon-free warmth and energy storage for Helsinki's heating needs.
The Hot Heart's proposal also featured an artificial island dome covered with tropical plants and warm pools, which the team claimed could be a ""new, global attraction for the city.""
Moving to a more sustainable future
""We did not expect the competition to yield one solution, which solves the whole puzzle. Instead, we now have in our hands a very wide range of solutions, which will help not only Helsinki, but also other sustainable and innovative cities looking for heating solutions,"" said Helsinki's Mayor Jan Vapaavuori.
Winning entrant Beyond Fossils proposed a model to transition Helsinki to clean energy through an auctioning system for energy producers, while Smart Salt City would use AI and a new form of limestone-based energy storage to meet the city's demands.
""We addressed a significant question with the challenge competition model and it generated thinking and discussions, both within the city and outside it, which may not have occurred otherwise,"" said Project Director of the Helsinki Energy Challenge Laura Uuttu-Deschryvere.
""The energy revolution and the fight against climate change require innovative and exceptional ways of finding solutions,"" she added.
More than half of Helsinki's heating energy is currently generated by burning coal, which will be banned in Finland as of May 2029.
The Hanasaari coal-fired plant will be closed by 2024, with coal use at the city's other main generating plant, Salmisaari, to end by 2029."

The headline figure: 63 percent of Finns are either very or quite satisfied with the way Prime Minister Sanna Marin (SDP) has handled the crisis. That said, it's not all good news for the PM – the proportion of respondents who said they were very satisfied with her performance has declined from 39 percent in March 2020 to 21 percent in March 2021.
The proportion of those saying they are worried about the pandemic rose slightly since January, the paper reports, from 70 to 75 percent.
Of those, 21 percent said the coronavirus was worrying them a lot, in what the paper says is the highest proportion an HS poll has recorded since it began asking the question in February last year.
The poll of 1,037 people was carried out online by Kantar TNS on behalf of Helsingin Sanomat.
Food delivery competition heats up 
As pubs, bars and restaurants in many parts of the country turn to takeaways to weather the economic impact of coronavirus-related shutdowns, some businesses are baulking at the costs of working with food delivery giants like Wolt and Foodora.
Oulu paper Kaleva reports on a new website, ""Kotiintilaus"", set up by the proprietors of Oulu's Cafe Stockholm.
According to Kaleva, cafe owner Päivi Illikainen broke off a contract with delivery app Wolt last year over concerns the company was taking too big a share of their revenue.
""The commission was so big that there was nothing left. We built a home-grown online store and started wondering if there were any other options out there,"" Illikainen told the paper.
The website partners with local taxi firm Otaxi to deliver orders. While Illikainen says speed and reliability are the service's ""trump card"", the costs are higher, charging 10 euros minimum for delivery.
For Iilikainen, the real benefit is the cost saving to her business. ""The system is less than half the cost for us entrepreneurs compared to Wolt. For example, if there are no customers, there are no costs,"" she told the paper.
Historic building seeks new tenants
A protected building on Helsinki's waterfront is looking for new tenants, according to a report in business daily Kauppalehti. 
The Alvar Aalto-designed headquarters of forestry firm Stora Enso will be vacated by the company later this year, the paper writes, leaving open a prime patch of real estate in a building many refer to as the ""Sugar Cube"".
The building, which sits on Helsinki's South Harbour near the Presidential Palace and Uspenski Cathedral, has been home to Stora Enso and predecessor company Enso-Gutzeit since it was built in 1962.
The property's agents, management company Newsec, say the main attraction will be the 400 square metre restaurant space on the top floor.
""I hope to find a restaurateur who will bring something new to Helsinki's restaurant map. The top floor can be reached without passing through the office space,"" Newsec's Jussi Kivitie told Kauppalehti."

Data provided by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) shows that there has been a 250 percent increase in the number of infections among children under the age of 10 over the past four weeks compared to a period of four weeks in November last year.
All other age groups averaged an increase of about 80 percent when comparing the same two periods, while the rise in the number of coronavirus infections among the over-80 demographic has been relatively small.
It therefore seems clear that vaccines have had a protective effect on the elderly age group, combined with the fact that older people have also restricted their social contacts more than young people.
However, it remains unclear what is causing the higher infection rates among children, although one possibility is the spread of more highly-contagious variants of the virus.
""Before we got the UK variant, about half of the members of a family became infected. Now it seems that the majority of them are getting sick,"" HUS's chief physician of infectious diseases Asko Järvinen told Yle Svenska.
From the data provided by THL, it appears that a growing number of adults have become infected recently and then in turn infected their children living within the same household. Petter Brodin, an assistant professor of immunology, told Yle Svenska that he agrees with this assessment.
""The most common site of infection is the home. And the most common way is that parents infect their children and not the other way around,"" Brodin said.
Increase in infections began before ski holiday
The increase in new infections among children under 10 years of age continued during the recent mid-term ski holidays, but the upward trend began before the holiday period began.
Brodin added that children are still not considered to be a driving force in the spread of infections, nor do children spread the disease as easily as adults.
He also emphasised that young children are usually either asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms if they contract the virus.
""This has been the case throughout the pandemic, and it is still the case now,"" Brodin said, adding that this was supported by data provided by the UK-based peer-reviewed general medical journal The Lancet.
On average, children and adolescents under the age of 18 have not been found to have had more severe symptoms due to contracting the UK variant than during the first coronavirus wave last year, the journal reported.
More testing increases number of positive results
To date, the highest number of infections has been in the 20-29 demographic of young adults.
However, an increase in infections has also been observed among under 10-year-olds in other European countries, such as Sweden and the United Kingdom, among others.
""It must be taken into account that more children have been tested now than before,"" Brodin explained.
In recent weeks, Finnish health authorities and hospital districts have recommended that asymptomatic people take coronavirus tests as well, which may explain the increased number of infections among children."

Security services say that foreign intelligence agencies have stepped up their efforts to gather intelligence online during the past year.
According to Supo researcher Veli-Pekka Kivimäki, the number of online espionage targets has risen in part because of the increase in the number of people working remotely.
""Not all security solutions may have been thought out completely when work activities went remote,"" Kivimäki told Yle A-Studio on Tuesday.
Travel restrictions imposed during the pandemic have also played a part in the shift to online spying, as they have limited opportunities to gather intelligence in person, Kivimäki said.
Corporate espionage growing
Speaking on A-Studio, Kivimäki said foreign actors would be most interested in gathering information on Finnish political decision-making and product development.
Mikko Hyppönen, research director of data security company F-Secure, said many companies had not been ready for the security threats the pandemic posed.
""When we didn't all have the means to be able to make remote connections via secure networks, companies were forced to make compromises,"" Hyppönen said.
""Information used to be physical. It was kept somewhere in a specific place. You had to go there to be able to steal it. But now, information today is completely virtual. It's data and it's on our computers,"" he explained.
Cybercrime the bigger threat
Last week Supo published a report saying that foreign intelligence services had accessed the internet routers of dozens of Finnish companies and individuals in order to conduct espionage.
But Supo's Kivimäki says people are more likely to fall victim to cyber criminals than state actors.
""Perhaps it is more of a threat profile that an individual citizen should think about. Those devices must be protected precisely so that they cannot be exploited by criminals,"" he said."

""Racism is a part of our society, and that has also been reflected in football. Even though we live in the 2020s and everyone thinks we have evolved as humanity, we still have a lot to improve,"" Sparv tells Yle Sport.
The Finnish captain is well-known as a player willing to talk about topics other than what happens on the football pitch. In recent years, he has taken a stance on issues such as women in sport, US police violence and racism, as well as climate change.
Sparv has also learned that athletes' opinions on any subject other than what happens on the playing field are not to everyone's liking. The midfielder experienced it first-hand following Finland's Nations League match against Wales last September.
Before the game kicked off, both sides 'took the knee'; a symbolic show of support for the global anti-racism 'Black Lives Matter' movement. It was reportedly the first time that a Finnish national team had taken a stand against racism at a competitive international fixture.
""Repulsive comments""
Many fans of the team expressed support for the gesture, but others were not so pleased.
""It's pretty common to get nasty comments on social media. However, the quality of the feedback after the kneeling gesture did come as something of a surprise. There were ""white lives matter"" messages, repulsive comments ... Someone wrote that he and his companions would no longer come to watch us,"" Sparv recalls.
The comments and messages came mainly through the social media channels of the national team, nicknamed the Huuhkajat or Eagle-Owls, as well as via Sparv’s own accounts. The commenters and critics said they were upset that politics had been brought into sport, and they called on the players to focus on football instead.
""You hear that a lot when an athlete takes a stand. However, I do not think this is about politics, but here we are talking about human rights,"" Sparv says.
The midfielder, who plays for AEL in the Greek Super League, has noticed that when players talk about social issues it tends to divide supporters into two camps. However, he added that the majority of the feedback received by the national team skipper has been encouraging.
""Many people like that the Eagle-Owls took a stand. Kneeling wasn’t just my thing, the whole team stood behind it. All the players and the backroom staff wanted to oppose racism,"" Sparv points out.
Silence ""not an option""
Finland’s captain says he began talking about social issues seven or eight years ago after realising that there are bigger issues in the world than success on the football field.
""When I was young, I was pretty selfish. I just wanted to train, focus on my own stuff, and develop as a football player. As I gained more experience, I realised that there are other interesting topics of discussion in the world too,"" he explains.
His views on these other topics were often greeted with negative, even very harsh, criticism. However, over the years he says he has developed a thicker skin and now enjoys discussing controversial topics, which includes listening to the opposing views of others if the tone remains respectful.

""If someone wants to discuss and debate like an adult, it’s easy to try to find a compromise or at least to talk about the issue. We can disagree. But there are too many people who just shout and swear on social media. I can't talk to them,"" he says, adding that despite the criticism he receives for speaking out, silence has never been an option.
The events of recent years have shown that the Finnish captain is not the only athlete or sports star with this view, as many others around the world have given their support to movements and causes such as the anti-racist Black Lives Matter. In Belarus, more than 2,000 top athletes have joined forces to oppose the violence and human rights violations of the current regime.
Sparv says he has followed this development within the sports world with pride.
""It has been great to see how athletes like LeBron James and Megan Rapinoe have used their social status and tried to do something outside of sports as well. They are good examples for everyone,"" he says.
Sparv, who became a father in January, believes that everyone can do their bit to make the world a slightly better place.
""It is quite amazing what Greta Thunberg has achieved. It shows how things can be influenced by one individual,"" Sparv says. ""We often ask what we can do in our own daily lives to create a just society. I want the Eagle-Owls to be more than just a successful football team."""
https://yle.fi/uutiset/11841577,How quickly will Finland get vaccinated?,https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/how_quickly_will_finland_get_vaccinated/11841577?origin=rss,"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 14:39:34 +0200","To date, more than 600,000 people have been vaccinated against the coronavirus in Finland.
But how soon will the rest of us be able to get our jabs?
Yle asked vaccine specialist Mia Kontio from the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) what will happen to the pace of the national vaccination programme in the coming weeks.
Here's what she had to say:
Will vaccine deliveries to Finland speed up?
MK: The delivery of the vaccines has been variable. Biontech Pfizer has promised that significantly more of the vaccine will come from them starting in early April, at around 160,000 doses a week.
Biontech Pfizer's vaccine supply has been very reliable all this time, so there is no reason to doubt that they will keep their promise.
Unfortunately, things are still fairly uncertain with AstraZeneca. They have stated that they will not be able to supply as many doses as originally intended, which is to say that while the number of doses will increase, it will not be by as much as originally hoped.
We are also going to receive the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The starting date for deliveries hasn't been specified yet, but there has been talk of a date in late April or early May. No information on quantities is available yet. That will be firmed up in the near future once they are granted a marketing authorisation, but any additional doses will of course speed up vaccination.
How many vaccine doses has Finland received so far?
MK: As of the end of last week, about 909,000 vaccines have arrived in Finland.
Story continues after photo.

How long is the period between a vaccine arriving in Finland and it being injected into someone?
MK: When talking about the vaccine doses we have received and the vaccines given we should bear in mind that some vaccines enter the country at the end of one week and are not distributed until the following week.
Also, different manufacturers handle distribution differently. Biontech Pfizer delivers its vaccines itself to about 20 locations in Finland where it's possible to store them at -70 C. The vaccines are then delivered directly to vaccination points from these locations.
The Astra Zeneca vaccine, on the other hand, is first delivered to a central warehouse in Finland, usually at the end of the week. The vaccines are then delivered from the central warehouse to 60 different locations, before they get to the vaccination sites, so it has a longer distribution chain.
We should bear in mind that there's a delay of a few days before an individual dose is marked as having been given. It takes about a week and a half for a dose to appear in the register as having been administered.
How many doses of vaccine are on their way in the coming weeks?
MK: Unfortunately relatively few are coming this week because last week Biontech Pfizer sent us too many. We got a two-week supply, so there won't be any coming from them this week.
Only Moderna and AstraZeneca will be delivered this week, approximately 45,000 doses, so this week there will be unusually few vaccines in the country.
The delivery from Moderna comes every other week. The numbers are quite small and there's no prospect of them increasing.
From next week onwards Biontech Pfizer will provide between 60,000 and 67,000 a week. AstraZeneca's deliveries vary quite a lot, from 15,000 to 100,000 a week.

How does this variation affect the vaccinations? 
MK: These fluctuations cause planning issues, as they make estimating the number of available vaccination appointments difficult. People get frustrated when it's announced that there are appointments available, but then they run out. It's hard to offer appointments when you don't know how many vaccines will be available.
It makes the vaccination process a bit last-minute. it would be good if we could offer appointments far in advance.
How important is the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to Finland's vaccination programme? 
MK: It doesn't play an especially significant role, mainly because Finland has not purchased much of it. Finland has bought 2.4 million doses, compared to 6.2 million of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine. The vaccination programme is a different matter. This [vaccine] is a good addition, but not hugely important in the grand scheme of things.
Hopefully they will handle the deliveries reliably and regularly, it would really be good in the current situation. A reliable, continuous flow of vaccines would make planning and forecasting easier.
Have the forecasts changed? 
MK: They have not changed. We still estimate that by the end of June, some 5-7 million vaccines will have arrived in Finland, some of which will go towards providing second doses. We estimate that by the beginning of July as many as 4.5 million people, meaning everyone over the age of 16, will have been vaccinated.
Over 110,000 people were vaccinated last week and our vaccination capacity has room to expand. Based on information from hospital districts, it is estimated that at best 550,000-600,000 doses could be administered in Finland. We're currently doing over 100,000, this can easily be doubled, tripled, or quadrupled. We're not yet at capacity.
Why has Finland ordered more vaccine doses than it needs?
MK: Finland has taken part in all the European Union's joint procurements. The preliminary agreements were made as early as last year, when it was not known which vaccines would succeed and which would make it to market.
The EU has agreements with seven manufacturers, of which four have received marketing authorisations within the EU.
Decentralisation is good because the schedules are so uncertain. And the agreements aren't binding. If a vaccine becomes ready to use but is no longer needed, then we won't take it.
How close are we to various countries having surplus vaccines? 
MK: Potentially come the autumn, but there are aren't exactly any stores anywhere bulging with excess vaccines. If there is a surplus, it will be sent to poorer countries in accordance with the EU's treaties."

There is a significant reason to increase Finland's participation in crisis management especially in Africa, according to the crisis management committee's chairman Johanna Sumuvuori (Green) said at the report's launch. Sumuvuori is also Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto's (Green) State Secretary.
The crisis management committee seeks a common vision and co-operation between all political parties.
Finland has traditionally emphasised that it participates in operations that aim to make Europe's immediate vicinity safer. The committee believes participation in crisis management in the immediate vicinity of Europe is crucial.
Haavisto stated that comprehensive crisis management is needed in the Sahel region and Mali, for example. His views were also backed by other MPs in a foreign and security police report, published last year.
According to the report, conflicts on the African continent have an effect in Finland and Europe.
Africa is a constantly evolving continent, but there is also potential for problems to grow there. The crisis management report considers issues such as climate change, population growth, poor governance, lack of future prospects, migration and terrorism to be risk factors.
Very few Finnish troops currently stationed across the world
There are currently only 360 Finnish soldiers stationed across the globe, which is the smallest number since the 1970s, with the exception of 2011. At the start of the millennium, there were as many as 2,000 Finnish soldiers in operations across the world.
Most Finnish soldiers are currently stationed in the Middle East, where Finland participates in conflict resolution operations in Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan, for example. Of these, Lebanon’s missions are under the UN flag, while the Iraqi OIR-operation is an international, U.S.-led alliance, and the Afghanistan operation is led by NATO.
Internationally, however, the focus has shifted to Africa, where eight out of the United Nations' 13 operations are currently active.
Less than a tenth of Finnish soldiers are stationed on the African continent. Around a fifth of Finland's civilian crisis management personnel are working on EU and UN operations in Mali and Somalia."

The checks apply to anyone arriving at Helsinki's sea ports, Helsinki-Vantaa airport or the busy Finnish-Russian border-crossing at Vaalimaa.
As a part of the check, a coronavirus test may also be carried out.
The compulsory checks will come into force on Thursday 18 March and will be in place until 31 March.
During the health examination, the person arriving into the country will be asked for a negative coronavirus test certificate, taken in the last three days.
A certificate proving a positive coronavirus test within the last six months is also accepted, if the certificate is deemed as being reliable. In this case, a person arriving into the country will avoid a coronavirus test immediately following their entry into Finland.
According to AVI, a person arriving from a country at risk refers to a person who has stayed in a country with a coronavirus incidence rate of more than 25 infections per 100,000 inhabitants during the two weeks preceding their arrival in Finland.
This rate of incidence is exceeded by a considerable amount in almost all European countries.
The new border checks will not apply to passengers on connecting flights at Helsinki-Vantaa, nor to cargo drivers or logistics workers in their work duties.
Refusing the mandatory health examination is a health protection violation, which may result in a fine or imprisonment of up to three months.
Vaalimaa clarifying the new rules
At the Vaalimaa border-crossing point, the regional health authority's chief physician Marja-Liisa Mäntymaa says that the new rules will be discussed in a meeting with the border and health authorities on Thursday morning.

In addition, all commuter train tickets are valid on long-distance trains on Thursday and Friday. Long-distance trains stop for commuters in Pasila, Tikkurila, Leppävaara, Karjaa, Riihimäki, Hämeenlinna, Toijala and Lahti.

Helsingin Sanomat also reports that Helsinki Regional Transport (HSL) is not providing extra alternative means of transportation. Buses running along main rail routes, as well as on Hämeenlinnanväylä, Tuusulanväylä and Lahdenväylä were heavily congested.
Alternatives and risks
The tabloid Ilta-Sanomat writes that HSL was urging commuters in the Helsinki region to avoid public transport during the strike, if possible.
For those who must travel, HSL recommended using its Journey Planner service, either web or mobile app.
Ilta-Sanomat also supplies an extensive listing of bus lines serving various destinations in the region.
In a by-lined commentary, Iltalehti reporter Joonas Alanne writes that from a public health point of view, the walk-out is irresponsible, hitting hardest at those people who cannot work from home during the epidemic.
The incidence rate for the coronavirus was 469 in Helsinki on Wednesday, 457 in Vantaa, 313.2 in Espoo and 236.1 in Kauniainen. The situation has only worsened since the restrictions were tightened a couple of weeks ago. Thanks to the railway sector union, writes Alanne, it could be even higher in two weeks.
Turku student outbreak
Turku's Turun Sanomat reports an outbreak of coronavirus infections in that city as a result of a student gathering that took place on 6 March.
The paper says dozens of young people were infected and several hundred more exposed as a result, many of them foreign exchange students.
Turun Sanomat points out that the situation is further complicated by the fact that many exchange students live in apartments with shared kitchens.
Students living in flats with shared kitchens or bathrooms are being urged to stay in their own rooms as much as possible, to wear masks while in shared spaces and to wash their hands frequently. Also, anyone who may have been exposed should get tested if showing even mild symptoms and voluntarily quarantine.
Finns Party edging ahead
A fresh poll published by Helsingin Sanomat shows the Finns Party making gains among voters in the run-up to June's local elections, while the Social Democratic Party has slipped slightly.
The poll found 21.5 percent voter support for the Finns Party, up by 0.4 percentage points since a similar survey in February.
Sakari Nurmela, research director of Kantar TNS, which conducted the poll, believes that the deteriorating coronavirus situation may have contributed to the advance in popularity for the opposition Finns Party.
Infection rates have risen sharply in March. The government is preparing for increasingly tough restrictive measures. In addition, it was decided to postpone the municipal elections due to the difficult public health situation. The opposition has described the postponement of the election as a failure for the government and the prime minister. The Finns Party was the only political group to oppose the delay.
Helsingin Sanomat writes that the situation looks good for the Finns Party. In addition to growing support, it has amassed a record number of municipal election candidates. The party now has over 1,500 more candidates than it did in the last municipal election.
Is alcohol essential?
The Swedish-language daily Hufvudstadsbladet notes that it is still uncertain whether visits to Alko alcohol retail shops would be regarded as an essential activity, if and when the government decides to impose stringent restrictions on movement.
While details of the government plan have not been made public, the paper says it is possible that shopping could be limited to essential store and pharmacy visits.
This paper raises the question of whether Alko shops would be allowed to remain open and if the public could still visit them.
Hufvudstadsbladet quotes Ismo Tuominen of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, who is responsible for the state's ownership control of Alko, as saying he has not yet been informed on the issue.
He pointed out, however, that the bulk of alcoholic drinks are sold through supermarkets, so if the intention is to ban sales of alcohol for a temporary period, those outlets should also be affected. ""There is no point in only closing the Alko shops,"" said Tuominen."

Nearly a quarter, 23 percent, of respondents to the survey reported employer policies that they considered unjustified restrictions on their freedom of speech.
Other restrictions imposed by employers were found to be bans on written pieces of commentary and opinion, and demands to review any interviews given to the media before publication. There are also reported cases of journalists being denied access to some workplaces.
Paula Ilveskivi, a lawyer at SAK, points out that employees have a constitutional right to express their opinions in public. It can, however, be limited in certain matters by requirements for professional confidentiality and loyalty requirements by the employer.
Of the shop stewards who responded to the survey, more than a quarter, 27 percent, said opinions publicly expressed by an employee at their workplace had led to action by the employer, usually a meeting with, or warning from the employer. In a few cases, the worker had been dismissed.
""In these situations, it would be considerably [more] helpful to jointly agree on clear guidelines and rules for each workplace on communicating workplace-related issues or opinions,"" Ilveskivi stated in a SAK press release.
The survey was conducted in late February and early March, receiving 825 responses from union shop stewards and occupational safety and health representatives."

Entailed ""Abuse of power: Coordinated online harassment of Finnish government ministers"" (external link here), the report states that the five ministers most affected are women and are the target of a massive, hostile attack that calls into question their values, decision-making and leadership qualities.
It found that the main topics triggering abusive messages were the Covid-19 pandemic, immigration, Finnish-EU relations, and socially-liberal politics. Most of the harassment came in messages posted by real individuals, not computer-programmed bots, and most were anonymous.
The Stratcom report drew on the findings of three recent Finnish studies, one of which investigated the extent and effects of online hate speech against politicians, while the other two studied the use of bots to influence political discourse during the 2019 Finnish parliamentary elections.
The first study, released by the Finnish government in November 2019 found that a third of municipal decision-makers and nearly half of all members of the Finnish Parliament have been subjected to hate speech online.
The Nato report sees a constant flow of hate speech and hostile feedback as threats to Finnish democracy. It notes that the Finnish government's 2019 study found that 28 percent of decision-makers who have been the subject of hate speech feel that their willingness to participate in the political decision-making process has decreased.
The Stratcom study focused on social media messaging via Twitter."

The foreign ministry’s Ambassador for Health and Wellbeing, Päivi Sillanaukee,told Yle Radio 1's Ykkösaamu that information provided by Russia about the production of the Sputnik vaccine in Germany, Italy and France is untrue.
Several media outlets reported this week that Russia's RDIF sovereign wealth fund confirmed it had reached ""agreements with companies from Italy, Spain, France, and Germany to launch production"" of the Sputnik vaccine.
""The people in charge there have pointed out that no such agreements have yet been concluded, and in any case it would require the approval of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and a wide range of other approvals from the pharmaceutical authorities in each country,"" Sillanaukee said, adding that Russia is testing the reaction of other countries with the announcement of the agreements.
She further stated that the start of production would in any case be slow, and would be unlikely to begin until the end of the year if agreements were indeed reached with states or companies.
Sillanaukee, who is also a member of the Executive Board of the World Health Organization (WHO), said that the development of the Sputnik vaccine is a scientific win for Russia.
Economic, political motives 
Russia has both economic and political motives in announcing the agreements, according to Jussi Toivanen, Chief Communications Specialist at the Prime Minister's Office.
Russia, he said, may want to disrupt EU unity by spreading false information.
""It can also have a purely economic motive: with the aim of getting trade,"" he added.
Hungary has already started using the Sputnik vaccine while the Czech Republic and Slovakia have ordered doses and indicated that they will begin rolling it out even without EMA approval. Russia is currently applying for a Europe-wide marketing authorisation for Sputnik from the EMA.
The application process begins with preliminary research that Sillanaukee said is now underway. No formal permit application has, however, as yet been submitted."

Some data security firms have linked the operation to the Chinese state.
In a press release on Thursday, the agency said that 2020 was a year of ""exceptionally intensive cyber espionage operations both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe"", which included the attempt to infiltrate Parliament’s IT systems.
The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) said at the time that the attack was detected by the legislature’s internal technical surveillance and the security of a number of parliamentary email accounts was compromised, some of which belonged to MPs.
The NBI announced via a press release on Thursday that the matter is being investigated as a suspected aggravated computer break-in, aggravated espionage, and aggravated message interception.
In its own statement, Supo said that the state cyber espionage operation APT31 was responsible for the attack.
APT31 has previously been linked to China’s state cyber operations, for example by security companies such as Checkpoint (external link) and FireEye (external link).
The NBI added that some indications of possible perpetrators were discovered during the analysis of material collected during the criminal investigation.
""We are investigating links to the APT31 group, but we will not disclose any details about the facts discovered as the criminal investigation is ongoing,"" Detective Superintendent Tero Muurman of the NBI said. ""The motive is under investigation. We have not excluded the possibility that the purpose of the attack was to gather intelligence to benefit a foreign state or to harm Finland's interests.""
Speaker of Parliament Anu Vehviläinen (Cen) said on Thursday that she considered it important that such a serious attack on Parliament had been traced.
""When the suspected crimes in an investigation are aggravated espionage, aggravated burglary, and aggravated breach of confidentiality, everyone understands how serious the matter is. Such activities are always an attack on our democracy and on Finnish society,"" Vehviläinen said.
Breach triggered extensive investigation
When a possible data breach was first suspected, Supo provided information to Parliament, on the basis of which the Parliament's IT administration could identify possible further hacking attempts.
Parliament acted in accordance with the instructions it received and further strengthened its information security, Supo said.
Supo also provided information to the National Cyber Security Centre Finland (NCSC-FI) so that it could improve its own monitoring capabilities.
When Parliament's own technical report revealed that the IT systems had been breached, Supo assessed that the constituent elements of an aggravated offence were met and reported the case to the NBI."

In addition, businesses will be compensated for up to 70 percent of their rental costs as well as other similar business-related expenses.
In addition to bars and restaurants, reimbursements for loss of earnings due to the closure order can also be claimed by gyms, public saunas, spas and indoor playgrounds, among others.
The compensation will be based on the company’s expenses in February 2021 as well as a statement of how much of the business has been affected by the closure. Coronavirus subsidies granted in the past will be taken into account and the maximum amount of aid should not exceed 1.8 million euros under EU state aid rules.
If the business has continued to provide takeaway food during the closure period, as is permitted under the government order, this will also be taken into account when calculating the amount of compensation.
Ministry: Total compensation bill about €70m
The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment estimated that the total amount of compensation paid out to businesses forced to close during the three-week period will be approximately 70 million euros.
The ministry added that about two thirds of this figure will be used to support small and medium-sized businesses and one third to support bigger companies.
The closure compensation currently proposed by the government applies to companies with up to 49 employees, with further support for larger businesses in the pipeline.
""However, we wanted to get support for small businesses up and running as soon as possible, so support packages for small and large companies are being prepared separately. Support for the event industry is also currently being prepared separately,"" Minister of Economic Affairs Mika Lintilä (Cen) wrote in the ministry's press release.
The support package for bars and restaurants is due to be discussed in Parliament alongside the proposal for general support for companies, or the so-called cost support 3.
The law allowing for the compensation of bars and restaurants is projected to come into force on 12 April, with the application for reimbursements open to companies by early May. Support for the cost of the compensation will be sought from the State Treasury.
Bars, restaurants, cafes and nightclubs have been closed since Tuesday, 9 March in 15 regions which are considered to be in either the accelerating or community transmission phase of the epidemic. Take-away and delivery food may still be sold.
The closure order is due to run until 28 March."

Finland's largest circulation daily, Helsingin Sanomat reports that police officials are already prepared, however, to enforcement these measures, if they are rolled out.
National Police Commissioner Seppo Kolehmainen told the paper, however, that if restrictions are imposed, they should be so clear and simple that both the authorities and the public understand the rules.
While he expressed the hope that restrictions on movement are not brought into force, if they are, the police will do their best to carry out the task of supervising them.
Helsingin Sanomat notes that the leaders of government parties will be meeting on Friday to consider the next steps in the battle against the epidemic and will possibly be discussing restrictions on movement.
Minister of Family Affairs and Social Services Krista Kiuru (SDP) told a press conference on Thursday that restrictions on movement have not been ruled out.
The issue was further highlighted on Thursday when Turku's Mayor Minna Arve filed a formal request for official assistance from the police in supervising quarantines during what she described as the city's worst outbreak of the virus.
Police Commissioner Kolehmainen told Helsingin Sanomat that he does not want to see a situation in which the police have to interpret the rules, or one in which police have to interrogate citizens about their comings and goings.
""Likewise, fines and other sanctions should be so simple that they can be understood by the police and the public,"" he added.
Reconsidering vaccination strategy
The tabloid Ilta-Sanomat carries a review of a Thursday evening Yle television discussion in which members of the national vaccination expert group suggested a change in strategy that would shift supplies of vaccines to areas with the highest rates of coronavirus infection.
The CEO of Helsinki University Hospital, Juha Tuominen pointed out that there is wide regional variation, with infection rates in some areas ten or more times higher than in others.
As Ilta-Sanomat notes, these ""red spots"" on the map are mostly in the capital region, along main commuter routes.
Tuominen stated that the public public is entitled to equal protection, but he also interpreted this as meaning that more vaccine should be made available where it is most needed. He argued that with the right targeting, one-fifth of hospitalizations caused by the coronavirus could be avoided.
""This is important at the individual level, and this is also important at the community level,"" Tuominen pointed out.
The Swedish-language daily Hufvudstadsbladet writes that if a decision is made to refocus vaccination efforts and distribution of vaccines, the move would take three to four weeks at best to implement the new policy in practice.
Under this new new system, the vaccines would be distributed on the basis of population, number of new infections and hospitalizations in recent weeks.
Meanwhile, Jyväskylä's Keskisuomalainen carries a survey by the Uutissuomalainen news group showing that the majority of hospital districts around the country are not in favour of vaccination strategy being changed.
According to the survey, 14 of the 20 hospital districts support the current vaccination schedule, at least in broad outline. Only in the Helsinki and Uusimaa hospital district and in the Länsi-Pohja hospital district in Lapland was there clear support for change.
Farewell to Malmi Airport
Helsingin Sanomat carries a text and photo review (pay-walled) of aviation history at Helsinki's Malmi Airport, which saw its final flight last weekend.
Article continues after photo.
Helsinki's Malmi Airport was long the country's most important aviation centre.Petteri Bülow / Yle
Built in 1936, Malmi Airport over the years served both aviation enthusiasts and professionals. It was Helsinki's passenger air traffic airport until a new one was opened in the rural countryside of present-day Vantaa in 1952.
During the Second World War, Malmi Airport was used by both the Finnish Air Force and for some time also by the German Luftwaffe.
In recent years, Malmi has been Finland's second busiest airport in terms of flight volumes after Helsinki-Vantaa. This past year, the coronavirus pandemic, it again became the country's busiest when traffic at Helsinki-Vantaa slowed down.
The owner of the land, the City of Helsinki, has decided to build housing in the area. Part of the field along with its buildings are protected.
Stormy weekend
Iltalehti tells readers that while Friday temperatures remain below normal for the time of year, for the most part the day should be dry and sunny.
However the weekend will bring snowstorms and blustery winds.
High winds are forecast to start on Saturday bringing snow to central and southern regions. By Saturday night or early Sunday morning Kainuu, Koillismaa and southern Lapland can expect to see heavy snowfall that will hit southern parts of the country as both snow and sleet.
Parts of the north and east are likely to be hit by usually high gusts of wind on Sunday."

Unlike in previous years, the happiness index included surveys on how countries have dealt with the coronavirus pandemic that has shaken the world for more than a year.
The report's authors said this year's survey examined the effects of the crisis on the structure and quality of people's lives as well as looked at how governments dealt with it.
Trailing behind Finland on the happiness index were Iceland, Denmark, Switzerland, and the Netherlands.
All of the Nordic countries were ranked within the list's top 10, while Estonia was 28th and Russia 60th most happy out of the index's total of 149 nations.
The southern African country of Zimbabwe was listed at the bottom of the happiness rankings. Meanwhile the 20 countries found at the bottom of the list were located in Africa, many of which were dealing with difficult situations, unrest or even civil war.
The annual, independent survey is organised by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. Rankings were reached via several surveys but chiefly used data from the Gallup World Poll.
About 1,000 respondents in each country were asked to, for example, rate the quality of their lives on a scale of zero to 10.
Other questions included how many times respondents laughed or felt joy and satisfaction the previous day. Conversely, the survey also took into account negative emotions such as asking how often respondents had felt worry, sadness or anger the previous day.
Corona crisis effect
The happiness report is in its ninth year of publication, but this year it also looked at how countries and their inhabitants had dealt with the coronavirus pandemic.
The survey asked how people's lives and feelings may have changed during 2020 compared to the previous few years.
The causes of negative feelings included weakened economies, health worries of the respondent or a relative as well as job losses and difficulty finding employment.
Meanwhile, respondents said positive feelings during the pandemic year had been prompted by volunteering, exercise, caring for a pet or a feeling of general gratitude.
While organised by the UN, World Happiness Report was compiled ""by a group of independent experts acting in their personal capacities. Any views expressed in [the] report do not necessarily reflect the views of any organization, agency or program of the United Nations,"" the report's website states."

Even so, Professor Harri Saxén, a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases at the Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District, says it is worthwhile continuing contact teaching.
""Closing schools is not an effective way to reduce infections. This has been found all over the world and everywhere it is considered a last resort,"" Saxén said in an Yle TV interview on Friday morning.
According to Saxén, the increase in the number of infections in children and younger people is in part a reflection of the general increase in infections among the entire population. Another reason is increased testing of children amid concerns about new virus variants.
Saxén told Yle that one-third of children and adolescents who test positive for the coronavirus have been asymptomatic.
However, serious viral infections in children have not increased in the Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District. There is also no clear increase in infections among school teachers or daycare personnel, which, according to Saxén, indicates that the problem of the spread is somewhere other than in schools.
The highest number of infections during the epidemic in Finland has been recorded among 20-29 year olds. The proportion of children and adolescents with coronavirus infections is statistically small, and there are few infections in schools. According to health authorities, the few outbreaks that have been seen in schools have often introduced by an infected adult.
The reason why the coronavirus seems to spread more slowly among children and adolescents is not known.
Adults still the main carriers
A study conducted in Pirkanmaa in the autumn revealed that there were few infections in schools and children's hobby groups in the region.
“The role of children in the spread of the virus in our data in the autumn was very small, but the situation has now changed a bit and their share as a source of infection now corresponds to their share of our population,"" explains Jaana Syrjänen, chief physician of the infection unit at Tampere University Hospital.
The main carriers of the virus are still people aged 20-59. The proportion they represent as a source of infection is significantly higher than their share of the general population.
Even so, earlier this month all the children's group hobbies in Pirkanmaa were put on break for three weeks.
According to Syrjänen, children's group hobby activities have rarely been a source of infection, and when they have, the virus has often been introduced by an adult.
""In our opinion, school attendance is a primary right of children and young people. So, we wanted to calm the situation,"" Syrjänen says.
She also points out that the number of infections among children and adolescents has not been significantly decreased by distance learning. Half of children and young people who do pick up the virus get infected at home by their parents, while a third of infections among 10-19 year olds have come from indoor group hobbies.
Syrjänen supports a broad return to contact teaching. She points out that the use of face masks, for example, significantly reduces the risk of exposure and high schools are less crowded now that final year students have already ended classes.
the chief physican adds that it should also be kept in mind that that young people in vocational education cannot learn their professions remotely, nor will many of them be able to telecommute in the jobs they are preparing for.
""Now it would be good to learn safe ways to work. For this age group, this is not likely to be the last respiratory infection pandemic they will have to deal with during their careers,"" Syrjänen predicts.
Both Syrjänen and Saxén also argue that the past year has been hard on young people. If children and young people are not allowed to see their friends in a school where physical contact can be controlled through masks and adult supervision, children are more likely to see their friends outside of school, where infection tracing becomes more difficult."

Mäki noted that the city was responsible for carrying out the tests.
On Thursday Turku Mayor Minna Arve announced that a major coronavirus outbreak among foreign exchange students had taken place, characterising the infection chain as the most serious seen to date in the city.
At least 71 cases had been diagnosed as of Thursday, with a very large number of individuals being exposed to the virus.

According to Anna Saarenoja, the communications manager of the Southwest Finland Police, it is not yet certain what these operational activities will be in practice.
""We have started preparations, that means planning work to implement the request for official assistance. As the day progresses, we will tell you more when the plan is ready and we start the actual measures,"" Saarenoja stated.
In a tweet, Police Chief Risto Lammi commented briefly on Friday morning that the department would be assisting local authorities with quarantine control if healthcare resources or powers were insufficient. According to Lammi, this would not be a matter of enforcing restrictions on movement.
The newspaper Turun Sanomat reported Thursday evening that police in Southwest Finland were conducting several preliminary investigations into quarantine violations.
Earlier this week, the city of Espoo reminded residents that breaking coronavirus quarantine rules is punishable by law. The intervention came after the city's police encountered more people violating quarantine rules in the first two months of this year than they did during all of 2020.
People breaking mandated quarantine can face fines or up to three months of jail time, even if they do not infect anyone else.
Food and hygiene products for exchange students 
The City of Turku will be providing food and hygiene products to local university foreign exchange students ordered into quarantine.
According to a city press release, about 70 international exchange students have been or will be ordered to isolate and just under two hundred more people who have been exposed to the coronavirus have been or will be quarantined by decision of public health officials.
The students have been provided with information about what quarantine and isolation mean, as well as instructions for those diagnosed with the coronavirus.
""Isolation and quarantine are orders issued in accordance with the Infectious Diseases Act, which must be observed,"" reminds Jutta Peltoniemi, the physician with responsibility for infectious diseases in Turku.
The food being provided to students is a collection of staple items. The first deliveries are scheduled for Friday.

If you sometimes skip a step, or re-use your mask, you're not alone.
A survey on the Yle website that garnered more than 6,000 responses found that nearly 94 percent of respondents admit to knowingly misusing their face mask.
This widespread sloppiness surprises Erja Mäkelä, a senior expert at the National Institute of Occupational Health.
""I expected many people to misuse masks, but I would not have thought that the result would have been so pronounced,"" says Mäkelä.
The reasons people gave for the deliberate misuse were consistent.
Those responding to the poll expressed apathy in regard to using face masks, and some questioned their efficacy. Cost was also a factor for some respondents.
Many believe that wearing a mask is inefficient from a protective standpoint, and felt they were justified in using the same mask more than once without washing it. Many believe they are keeping others safe in doing that, while only putting themselves at risk.
According to Mäkelä, remnants of the virus can remain on the surface of a mask for 11 days. Therefore, washing fabric masks is absolutely essential, and disposable masks must be disposed of.
""If pathogens have entered the mask, they may spread to your hands, and from your hands to your nose or eyes when touching the mask. Pathogens can also be transmitted from your hands to your mask and then into your airways,"" says Mäkelä.
Face masks do protect users, says Mäkelä, pointing to the fact that masks are used in healthcare and there are considerably fewer corona infections when masks are used and people are exposed to Covid.
""It cannot be said that the protection is perfect, but most of the airway secretions are left inside the mask when used properly,"" says Mäkelä.
""Do your best""
One of the most common reasons for people knowingly misusing their masks, based on responses received by Yle, is that it is cumbersome to use the mask correctly.
Many of those polled felt that the current instructions for using masks are designed to work inside a hospital, but the implementation is impossible in everyday life.
According to Mäkelä, the instructions are so strict because scientific research has shown that this is the most effective use of a mask. While the correct use of masks can be challenging, Mäkelä acknowledges that doing your best goes a long way.
""The most important thing is that they are used. The second most important thing is that they are clean,"" she says.
Peer pressure a factor
A large proportion of respondents said they wore a mask simply in order to not attract attention by not complying with recommendations. According to psychologist Saara Nolvi, social pressure, and getting people to follow the recommendations under the guise of it, is an intended effect of the government’s directives.
""People try to do what is expected of them. But it can also lead to using the mask that sits at the bottom of their pocket,"" she says.
According to Nolvi, mask-users need to be rewarded for their diligence. That is, they should expect that the use of masks would eventually lead to a return to normal. She says that Finns likely feel that life in the time of Covid-19 goes from one disappointment to another, with no end in sight.
""You’re promised a vaccine, then there are none to be had. There is no halfway mark, no prize to encourage you to keep going. It seems like this will last for a very long time, with no knowledge of when you’re able to resume your old life,"" says Nolvi.
Nolvi believes it would be helpful to remind people of a job well done, and that the worsening situation is due to new variants of the virus and not lack of effort made by the general population. She emphasises that it's better to encourage people than to blame them.
""It might also be useful to acknowledge how difficult the situation is from the citizen’s point of view. It might even increase the correct use of masks."""

""An uncontrolled number of people have packed in though the plan was to have 15 groups of six people. Other protesters were supposed to remain outside the area,"" Police Inspector Jarmo Heinonen told Yle, saying police worried about the gathering’s health implications.
The demonstration drew some 300 people when it departed from Helsinki’s Senate Square around 2pm. The procession grew to around 400 individuals by the time it reached Citizens’ Square by Oodi library.
Unhappy about health measures
Activists said they were protesting Covid restrictions, which they said did more harm than good while curtailing people’s freedom. In addition to restrictions, demonstrators also objected to vaccinations and face masks.
Protester Christoffer Weiss said he travelled from Karjaa to Helsinki to join the demonstration.
""We’re here to question authorities’ measures. More than six people can’t gather, but you can still go to the store. We also wonder if officials aren’t exaggerating the danger of the pandemic since people die of the flu every year,"" he said.
Jonas Nordberg said he was demonstrating against limits on societal debate.
""This event has nothing to do with coronavirus. It’s about the right to be a free citizen in this country,"" he told Yle.

Some municipal parking enforcers have, however, been using them for years as Finland introduced the limited use of body cameras in early 2018.
Parking attendants in Vaasa and Jyväskylä have experienced fewer threatening incidents since they began wearing body cameras on their uniforms, city officials told Yle.
Jyväskylä said one in nine of its metre readers wears a bodycam.
""Abusive language and threats [against attendants] have more or less disappeared since we started using the cameras,"" Timo Lampinen, a lawyer for the city of Jyväskylä said.
Mikkeli and Iisalmi meanwhile told Yle that bodycams had not had a significant impact on motorists’ behaviour. Officials in smaller towns said they faced fewer parking-related issues in general, as their central areas had an abundance of parking space. The pandemic was also causing people to drive and move about less, they said.
Kotka introducing bodycams
The southeastern town of Kotka said it plans to introduce bodycams for its parking enforcement officers this summer in an effort to minimise motorists’ aggressive behaviour.
Last year, Kotka's parking enforcers reported 25 threatening situations, including an incident where an angry motorist attempted to run over one of the city’s parking attendants.
Eija Grönholm, who heads digital services for the city of Kotka, said parking inspectors will be instructed to turn cameras on anytime they suspect a conflict situation. In such cases, inspectors are required to notify the other party that recording is turned on. Grönholm said video footage provides a legal shield for both motorists and inspectors.

They will now be held on 13 June, a decision the committee says is necessary in order to protect people's lives and health, but, most importantly, to ensure every citizen’s right to vote.
The committee also suggested that the term of office of the newly elected municipal councils should start as early as the beginning of August and not at the beginning of September, as proposed by the government.
The current term of office would finish at the end of July. According to the committee, the reason for the amendment is that, once the result of the new elections has been confirmed, the current councils no longer have a mandate to govern.
From a democratic standpoint, the committee says it is desirable for the new councils to take office as soon as possible after the election results.
Similarly, having the terms of the new councils elected in June shortened as a result of the postponement must be avoided, according to the committee's press release.

Finns consume more dairy per capita than any other nation in the world, and many adults drink milk with their meals.
However, dairy milk's status as the nation's drink of choice is now under threat as Finns are increasingly turning down cow's milk in favour of oat milk, reports Finland's largest circulation daily, Helsingin Sanomat.
According to the paper, in 2019 Finns drank an average of 102 litres of milk per capita. That's around five percent less than in the previous year. Finland is now said to be going through an ""oat boom"", and the trend is also visible worldwide.
People are increasingly favouring plant-based products mainly due to the environmental impact of dairy production. The popularity of plant-based products has meant that dairy producers are now making big attempts to reduce their carbon footprint.
Government negotiations on new restrictions
Helsingin Sanomat also reports that the government is planning to propose a special law to restrict movement and mandate masks to help combat the spread of coronavirus.
The government is meeting at noon on Monday to discuss the current coronavirus situation and negotiate bringing in the new rules.
The law would initially enter into force in the Helsinki metropolitan area and the Turku region, where the coronavirus epidemic is at its worst.
A plenary session of the government is planned for Tuesday, where the government may decide to send the proposal to Parliament.
Appetite for municipalities to issue wolf hunting permits
A survey by farmer's union daily Maaseudun Tulevaisuus revealed that around half of the respondents were in favour of transferring decision-making regarding wolf hunting permits to municipalities.
Currently, hunting permits are issued by the Finnish Wildlife Agency. Authorisation to hunt wolves is only granted in exceptional cases, where there is a threat to public safety, for example.
In eastern and northern Finland, around 60 percent of respondents wanted the authority on permits to be transferred to municipalities. In the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, just under half were in favour of municipal permits.
Finland's wolf population has expanded significantly since early 2019, especially in the west of the country.
The Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke) estimated that there were 30 wolf packs, or 216-246 wolves in the country in March 2020, which is a quarter more than in the previous year.
The municipalities that have escaped Covid
Tabloid Ilta-Sanomat identified municipalities where, according to statistics by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), under five Coronavirus infections have been confirmed throughout the pandemic. These ""corona-free"" municipalities are mostly located in Åland and central parts of Finland.
However, the exact number of coronavirus infections in the municipalities is unknown, as THL does not provide exact infection rates for municipalities with less than five infections. So they could have between zero and four infections.
Warm weather on the way
Saturday marked the Spring Equinox, and the weather seems to have gotten the memo.
Temperatures are set to rise from Tuesday onwards, with southern parts of the country enjoying temperatures of up to 10 degrees Celsius, and up to 8 degrees in Lapland, reports tabloid Iltalehti."

The study aims to gain a better understanding of substance abuse during pregnancy to help target therapies for children exposed in utero.
Researchers are planning to test one thousand urine sample from pregnant women in Helsinki and Lahti for traces of alcohol, nicotine and cannabis.
The samples will be anonymised, according Mirjami Jolma, a researcher specialising in pediatric neurology. Jolma’s study aims to draw information that women are not inclined to reveal during discussions with maternity clinic nurses or divulge in health surveys.
""These are sensitive issues and when asked, most will deny drinking during pregnancy,"" Jolma explained, adding that alcohol can be detected in urine five days after consumption.
Cognitive impairment
Jolma said Finland does not have accurate figures on how many women abuse substances during pregnancy or how many children this behaviour affects.
""International studies suggest that two to five percent of kids have been exposed to significant amounts of alcohol during pregnancy,"" she explained.
Jolma said many of the children arriving at child psychiatrists’ offices were exposed to alcohol and tobacco in utero.
""It’s a pity we often don’t have information on potential exposure which would help us make more accurate diagnoses.""
While analysing anonymous samples won’t help anyone on the individual level, information on maternal substance use could eventually help treat exposed children.
Foetuses exposed to alcohol typically have challenges learning, hyperactivity problems and trouble concentrating, according to Jolma.
""We often think that they need help being brought up and that they are underachievers. But in reality, the root of the problem may be the alcohol they were exposed to before they were born that caused a permanent brain disorder,"" she explained.
Jolma’s study has been collecting samples since last autumn from Helsinki Women’s Hospital and the Prenatal Screening Unit on Bulevardi. Päijät-Häme Central Hospital’s maternity clinic also provided samples. This spring the collection of urine samples will begin at maternity clinics in Lahti as well as in Helsinki’s Kallio district."

Today one in five Covid patients don't make it out of ICUs.
Patients now spend an average of 11 days in ICUs, down from 14 days at the end of last August, hospital figures extending to February show.
However the rising average age of those admitted to ICUs this year has contributed to a slight rise in death rates, as those over 60 have a higher risk of succumbing to the virus than younger adults.
Dexamethasone and less invasive ventilation
Intensive Care expert Matti Reinikainen said two factors were contributing to shorter ICU stays: the steroid dexamethasone, which has been administered to patients since last summer, and ICUs putting fewer patients on ventilators, a procedure requiring general anesthesia.
Dexamethasone, the same drug that former US President Donald Trump took as parts of his treatment, helps control inflammation and prevent lung damage--an approach reducing the need to ventilate patients.
This year, some 40 percent of Covid patients have received intubation and ventilation, down from 60 percent at the end of last summer.
Reinikainen, who heads anesthesiology and intensive care at Kuopio University Hospital, said less invasive care had most likely helped speed patients’ recovery.
ICU deaths up
More patients admitted to ICUs are now dying than during the first wave of the pandemic. Reinikainen said this was due to the older age of patients now being admitted.
At the end of last August 16 percent of Covid patients admitted to ICUs died. Today that number has risen to 21 percent.
Less than a quarter of those in ICUs last spring were between 60 and 69 years of age, but now that age group makes up more than 35 percent.
Last year, 70-79 year-olds made up some 15 percent of ICU patients. Now they are more than a quarter of those admitted.
No time to relax
Reinikainen said Finland needs to raise more crisis awareness around the pandemic to help prevent hospitals from filling up with Covid patients.
""Last spring a new and frightening disease deserted city streets. You don’t see that now,"" he said. ""The [hospitalisation] trend is pointing up.""
Public health institute THL estimates that between 25 and 44 Covid patients will require ICU care in the coming week. This would mean that Finland could see as many people in intensive care as it did during last spring’s one-time peak of 83 ICU patients."

According to the police, the weekend's demonstration did not proceed as had been agreed with organisers. Around 400 demonstrators turned up, and smaller groups merged into bigger ones once the demonstrations started, despite current rules that limit public gatherings to six people.
Many people on social media have questioned why the police allowed demonstrators to break current coronavirus restrictions.
""Of course, the police's main task is to ensure public safety. In this type of situation, we also try to promote cooperation, so from that point of view the outcome can be considered a success.

Police tried to direct the protesters into smaller groups, but to no avail.
""I find it very dubious for people to gather in this way, without caring about the safety of others,"" he continued.
The question now is whether the protest will possibly give citizens the impression that coronavirus restrictions can be freely broken. According to Kolehmainen, this is not the case.

A study carried out last year by the Finnish Institute of Health and Welfare (THL) found that the dustier the air in Helsinki, the more often City of Helsinki employees were on sick leave.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute's air quality index shows that air quality has deteriorated in other places as well.
On Monday morning, the air quality was measured as 'poor' at two measuring points just outside the centre of Helsinki. At the same time, air quality in Pori was deemed to be 'very poor', according to the index.
""There is a lot of street dust in the air, especially near busy streets and roads. According to the weather forecast, this week will be sunny, which will further reduce air quality due to the street dust,"" HSY's specialist Nelli Kaski wrote in a press release.
Spring is peak time for street dust
The street dust is mainly created through road gravel dust and studded tyres grinding the tarmac. Studded winter tires wear the asphalt, creating dust, which rises into the air as the roads dry.
In the Helsinki metropolitan area, dust concentrations can at times rise to up to ten times the normal levels.
According to HSY, the largest amounts of street dust usually occur during March-April, but the situation varies according to the weather and air currents.
Street dust is particularly harmful to people sensitive to air pollution, such as asthmatics, young children, the elderly, and those with coronary artery disease or Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In addition, street dust often exacerbates the symptoms of heart and respiratory disease.
It can also cause symptoms such as a runny nose, cough, and itchy throat and eyes among healthy adults.
""The physical symptoms created by street dust can be alleviated by avoiding busy areas, especially when exercising,"" Kaski said."

Marin made the comments on Monday on the way to meet with government members about ordering further societal restrictions in an aim to improve the country's worsening coronavirus situation.
The government is considering limiting peoples' freedom of movement, mandating the use of face masks and extending the ongoing partial shutdown, which is due to expire on 28 March.
""I hope that we can reach a decision, but I know that several are critical [towards restrictions],"" Marin said when she arrived at the midday meeting held at the House of Estates in Helsinki.
Cabinet members are also due to discuss the possibility of continuing the recent three-week restaurant and bar closures in certain regions, as well as possible distance learning measures for schools and colleges.
""Personally, I anticipate that the restaurant closures will continue, but the decision will ultimately be in the hands of the government and parliamentary groups,"" she said before the meeting.
She said that several of the government's parliamentary groups would meet on Monday afternoon to discuss the proposals.
Curfews: Some in favour, some opposed
The leader of the Centre Party, culture minister Annika Saarikko, said that her party was in favour of curfews.
""As long as the restrictions on movement are strictly limited to areas where the epidemic is at its worst and most necessary, and also limited in time. Not nationally, not even provincially,"" Saarikko said.
Saarikko said she hoped that decisions about restrictions would be reached unanimously among the government's five parties, as was the case last spring.
Meanwhile, justice minister Anna-Maja Henriksson (SPP) said that the restricting of people's movements could only be implemented for absolutely necessary reasons.
Her party has opposed restrictions like curfews on constitutional grounds.
""We are a constructive party, we are going to negotiate. We are consulting with authorities and experts. Let's see what the end result will be,"" Henriksson said on her way into the meeting.

She said that the government has examined measures like mandating the use of face masks as well as ordering telecommuting for all workers able to do so. Ohisalo also noted that Finland could begin demanding negative coronavirus test certificates from travellers at the borders, but pointed out such measures would require a law change.
According to PM Marin, Finland's police departments would be needed to enforce further societal restrictions. Meanwhile, Ohisalo said that the police would need more resources to do so.

""We've received a lot of calls from retirees asking about how to pay off their debt,"" said Guarantee Foundation project coordinator Maria Rumpunen.
According to the foundation, the coronavirus crisis is at least partly to blame for the situation.
Many recent retirees have been doing gig work or run small-scale businesses, which has provided additional income to their pensions. However, the foundation said, the pandemic has put an end to many of these small businesses and led to financial difficulties.
In addition, people are increasingly retiring while they still have debt.
""The debts have often been taken at a stage in life when people were still in salaried employment. Then they have retired, thinking they will pay off their debt with their extra earnings. Now, when the additional income has decreased, it comes as a surprise that their pension is actually quite small and not necessarily enough to pay off debt,"" Rumpunen explained.
Debtors increased by the thousands
The worsened financial situation of the elderly has also been reflected in foreclosure statistics among that age group.
At the end of last year, there were 39,975 debtors aged 63 and over in Finland, compared to 33,242 in the previous year. The average debt per debtor was approximately 27,000 euros.
Juhani Toukola from the National Enforcement Authority of Finland (Ulosottolaitos)--the national enforcement agency concerning debt matters--said that pension foreclosures clearly increased more than wage foreclosures did last year, for example.
""This of course means that financial difficulties are also commonplace among older age groups,"" Toukola said.
Toukala said he thought there were many reasons behind this. The pandemic causing a decrease in gig-work may have had an impact, although financial difficulties are usually reflected in foreclosure statistics later on.
Foreclosure figures did not increase significantly last year, he noted.

According to the city's current information, fewer than 200 students were exposed to the virus in the outbreak.
However, as more test results were still due to arrive this week, the number of positive tests are likely to increase, according to the City of Turku's infectious diseases physician, Jutta Peltoniemi.
""So far there have been surprisingly few positive test results,"" Peltoniemi said, adding that contact tracing efforts were ongoing.
Just over 70 coronavirus cases were confirmed among students in the city last week.
Last Friday, the regional authority ordered all 65 residents at a single student dormitory to mandatory health checks, which in practice meant being tested for coronavirus infections. However, the authority did not issue a similar order for other dormitories.
Mayor: Situation still serious
Despite the low numbers of new cases over the weekend, mayor Arve said on Monday that the situation remained serious.
However, she noted that the city's worsening epidemic situation was not entirely due to the outbreak among students, adding that a slight improvement had taken place following the recent implementation of heightened restrictions.
Echoing Arve's assessment, Chief Medical Officer of the Hospital District of Southwest Finland, Mikko Pietilä, confirmed that the student outbreak was not behind the city's overall coronavirus situation.
He said that the student outbreak had not caused an increase in the need for Covid-19 treatment at Turku University Central Hospital.
Amid the news of the outbreak, on Friday the city asked the police to assist in monitoring quarantines, particularly around exchange student dormitories. Local police reported that surveillance operations went smoothly over the weekend.
The police department's assistance in quarantine monitoring was scheduled to end at 7pm on Monday.
However, quarantine surveillance at dormitories in the Turku Student Village as well in the districts of Varissuo and Luolavuori were scheduled to continue with assistance from private security firms.

""The picture consists of independent works I have photographed over the years, which have been combined into a large mosaic by gradually closing the gaps between the shots.""

Creating the complex image required dedication and perseverance as well as creativity and an in-depth understanding of space, he said.
Each image within the mosaic is an independent artwork and all are available on the photographer’s blog, which CNN writes has had 750,000 visitors since the image was published on 16 March, up from a previous average of about 1,000 visitors a day.
Worldwide attention
Metsävainio took the photographs that make up the mosaic at his observatory in Oulu, and he believes the accuracy and depth of exposure make the image unique.
""This is a significant image for me, but the media interested in space, art and technology have also appreciated the work of art I created,"" he told Yle.
His tweet announcing the publication of the image was picked up by popular photography website PetaPixel, and from there by several media outlets around the world.

""The attention the picture has received worldwide is huge,"" Metsävainio said. ""As a visual artist, it is important for me that the image evokes feelings and thoughts, even if one does not know anything about its subject.""
The photographer's images have appeared in National Geographic and NASA publications, as well as television and movies.
He also participated in a live virtual broadcast hosted by the Science Museum of London last year alongside Queen guitarist and astrophysicist Brian May, and published a 3-D book about cosmic clouds with the musician and Astronomy Magazine editor David J Eicher."

Most of the infections are in the Helsinki University Hospital District (HUS) area, with around 3,000 new cases confirmed each week. According to Markus Mäkijärvi, Chief Medical Officer of HUS, at the current level, the number of patients is increasing and causing an increasing workload in healthcare.
""I would say the threshold [of what the healthcare system can cope with] is 3,000 to 4,000 infections a week in the HUS area. More than 4,000 infections a week is a figure that will start to have serious consequences on our healthcare system. The current 3,000 infections per week mean a lot of work and sweat, and some patients are already receiving inferior treatment,"" says Mäkijärvi.
HUS officials predict infections will continue the same, or will increase slightly, in the next few weeks.
""If the infections have started to decrease, we will see it in around a weeks' time on the hospital wards, and in a few weeks in the ICU,"" HUS development director Visa Honkanen told HS.
Tampere University's professor of epidemiology Pekka Nuorti estimates that current restrictions are not enough, as the British variant of the virus is so infectious.
According to the professor, people in Finland have grown used to the large number of cases.
""We currently have infection rates significantly higher than before Christmas. The situation is serious, there is no doubt about it.""
The government is expected to make an announcement later on Tuesday on whether new restrictions will be brought in.
Vaccines on the dark web
Tabloid Ilta-Sanomat conducted an investigation into the sale of coronavirus vaccines on the dark web. As well as unnamed vaccines, a number of vaccines purporting to be made by Pfizer were spotted on the sites.
The price of a multi-dose bottle containing around ten doses of what was supposedly the Pfizer vaccine, was selling for 40 USD (36 euros). The vials containing an unnamed substance were selling for 210 USD and 700 USD (176 euros and 587 euros respectively).
The Sputnik vaccine was not found even on Russia's largest dark web marketplace.
In addition, counterfeit vaccination certificates were also on sale. Ilta-Sanomat found a number of vaccination certificates, allegedly officially issued by Russian authorities. The price for these ranged from 40 to 56 euros.
For the fake certificates, buyers are asked to send in their personal information, after which the buyer is sent a fake vaccination certificate in their own name. The sellers are likely to be part of large criminal organisations, the tabloid reported.
According to Sami Paaskoski, Chief Pharmacist at Finland's pharmaceutical regulator Fimea, they are aware of the phenomenon and Fimea is monitoring the situation.
Forest inventory
Farmers' union newspaper Maaseudun Tulevaisuus reports on Finland's National Forest Inventory, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year.
The inventory's aim is to monitor and provide information on regional and national forest resources, land use and forest health status and diversity, among other things.
The data produced has proved so valuable that the inventory is repeated every ten years or so.
""The national forest inventory is more necessary now than ever before,"" said Kari T. Korhonen, a leading researcher at the Natural Resources Institute (Luke), and who has led the national forest inventory since 2004.
Finland is under pressure to produce new types of information due to its importance even at an international level. Finland is committed to producing national forest data for statistics collected by the UN and its climate agreement."

The threat has remained at level 2 (elevated) on the four-point scale, the same as last year, but the agency added that the activities of far-right groups in particular are becoming increasingly worrying.
Finland has remained at terror threat level 2 since the terrorist attack in Turku in August 2017.
Far-right threat increasing
Supo previously reported in October last year that the danger posed by far-right extremism had intensified in Finland, and it has continued to identify far-right operators with the capacity and motivation to carry out a terrorist attack.
These groups grew in number during the mid-2010s, but their expansion has levelled off in recent years.
""The far-right counter-terrorism targets identified by Supo are typically linked to the extreme right-wing international online environment,"" Supo Director Antti Pelttari wrote in the press release, adding that evidence of concrete preparations for an attack have also emerged.
Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday morning, Supo's Head of Analysis Pekka Hiltunen explained that an example of this would be acquiring equipment suitable for an attack.
Police suspected an anti-immigration, far-right group called Nationalist Alliance (Kansallismielisten liittouma in Finnish) of preparing to commit a violent crime last year, but authorities decided not to pursue the case due to a lack of sufficient evidence.
The plans came to light during a police investigation into the attempted murder of Finns Party aide Pekka Kataja last year, where far-right involvement was also suspected.
Supo further noted that the 'Great Replacement' theory, which claims that the white European population is being demographically and culturally replaced with non-European people through mass migration, has been increasingly cited in far-right circles.
The term has also been used in Finland by a number of MPs, including Finns Party Jussi Halla-aho and the party’s vice-chair Riikka Purra.
Purra justified the use of the term in relation to discussions around demographic change during an interview with Image magazine (external link in Finnish) in January.
Supo director Pelttari did not wish to comment on the use of the term by politicians during the Tuesday morning press conference.
Radical Islamist terrorism 'remains a threat'
The most significant terrorist threat on a global scale is posed by radical Islamists, Supo said. The weakened ISIL terrorist organisation in the Middle East is still actively producing propaganda in many languages and agilely exploiting various online platforms from Tiktok to the chat service Jodel.
The threat of Islamist terrorism to Finland is primarily posed by individuals who may be influenced or become radicalised by such propaganda, the agency added.
""Several people returned to Finland from the Syrian conflict zone in 2020. Most of these returnees are likely to continue operating in radical Islamist networks, for example by recruiting supporters and disseminating extremist ideology,"" the report stated.
Supo added that while those returning from conflict areas often become disillusioned with the ideology, most are likely to continue to operate in radical Islamist networks, posing an ongoing threat to national security.
The report also noted the role played by domestic radicalisation, adding that there are families in Finland where the third generation has become influenced by extremist ideology. In such families, children may grow from an early age in a radicalised environment that is difficult to break away from, the report pointed out."

The SOSTE social barometer, published on Tuesday, polled 1,099 people working in social and health services, the senior staff at TE employment services, and Kela's benefit and customer services.
The survey highlighted that a significant amount of social workers were concerned about people with mental health or substance abuse issues and other difficulties in particular.
The results of the survey found that the Finnish welfare system is able to support people with clear and simple problems, such as those requiring food aid or housing and benefits.
On the other hand, for those with more complex issues, help has often not been as easily accessible.
""The results are worrying. It seems that our social security system is failing at what should be the core of social work: helping those most in need. The bigger the issue, the worse we are at responding to it,"" said Minna Kivipelto, research manager at the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) in a press release.
The survey noted that some people have slipped the net as they have not been able to use the remote and digital services offered, for example.
According to social workers, the needs of those waiting for mental health or disability services have been poorly met.
""It's a big fallacy if, in exceptional circumstances, we expect everyone to have the ability to actively seek help themselves. There are a lot of people, young and old, who for one reason or another are already in need of support even under normal circumstances,"" says Anne Eronen, researcher at SOSTE.
The gaps in the public services have been often filled by non-profit organisations, parishes and volunteers, whose role is estimated to have grown considerably during the pandemic. Much of the support has focused on offering practical help, such as food assistance, as well as providing counselling and psychological and social support."

Identity information was compromised in about 45,000 cases, with one-third of the successful thefts originating on social media platforms, the firm added.
The survey results suggest a significant uptick in identity theft attempts from the previous year, when an estimated 600,000 people were targeted.
Identity theft refers to an attempt to use another person's personal information, for example to make a purchase or take out a loan, leaving the related bill to be paid by the victim of the theft.
The recent widespread use of technical support scams have been a factor in the rising number of identity theft attempts, according to Finland’s National Cyber Security Centre.
The survey conducted by MySafety also found that an item was purchased with the stolen identity in almost half of all identity theft cases last year. However, the financial losses incurred remained relatively small, with a third of victims reported losing less than a hundred euros and the remaining two-thirds even smaller amounts.
MySafety’s survey further found that identity theft attempts do not seem to target a specific group.
""Everyone is equally vulnerable to this type of crime, regardless of place of residence, job title, education, gender, age and so on,"" the company’s CEO Niclas Fagerlund wrote in the press release.
Some 62 percent of identity theft attempt victims said they did not contact any authority after the incident.

Aumo noted that roughly one percent of companies are foreign-owned, but they have a significant impact on the Finnish economy. A company is recorded as foreign-owned if more than ten percent of its ownership is based abroad.

Kamara is in Finland for the national team's World Cup qualifier against Bosnia-Herzegovina on Wednesday.
Before a press conference in Helsinki on Tuesday, the national team's press officer said that Kamara would not be answering questions about the incident, on legal advice.
""The support's been great so far and I'm thankful for it,"" said Kamara. ""Can't really say much more but very happy with the support and I'm happy that everyone's stuck by me.""
Kamara said last week that Slavia Prague midfielder Ondrej Kudela had covered his mouth, sworn and used a racist term, enraging the Rangers players and prompting supportive 'I stand with Glen' statements from clubs, fans and players across Scotland.
Kudela denies the charge, as does his club. Slavia fans posted pictures of themselves holding a racist banner directed at Kamara in the aftermath of the game.
""Full support""
On Monday Finland players donned 'I stand with Glen' t-shirts for a media event, stating they fully supported him.
""Racism doesn't belong in sport or anywhere else,"" said Norwich City striker Teemu Pukki on Monday. ""It's a real shame this has happened. From what I know having gotten to know Glen, he would not react in that way unless something was really said.""
""It's really wrong that this kind of thing happens and hopefully something will be done about it. It was big news in England and we talked about it in our team (Norwich) too,"" said Pukki.
Finland coach Markku Kanerva said the team was united behing Kamara, and that spoke to the group's togetherness.
""Yes, absolutely, one of the team's biggest strengths is team spirit, caring for and respecting each other in a fantastic way, in this case as well.""
Kamara was also asked about his contract at Rangers, after his manager Steven Gerrard had urged the club to tie him down.

On Monday the government had convened for eight hours of talks, but only decided to extend the current three-week shutdown of eat-in dining at restaurants.
On Tuesday parties were divided over the best way forward, with the Prime Minister Sanna Marin (SDP) saying that curfews and restrictions on movement would only be brought in if they were 'unavoidable'.
That is also a key consideration for parliament's Constitutional Law Committee, which must sign off on any proposal. It was clear on Tuesday that parties inside and outside the government were unconvinced that this condition had been met.
Opposition leaders were invited in to hear the government's proposals and expert assessments, before government ministers continued deliberations.
""More measures are of course needed,"" said National Coalition Party leader Petteri Orpo as he left the talks. ""I'm not convinced that a stay at home order would reduce close contacts. These indoor physical meetings should be reduced by other measures.""
Finland's National Institute for Health and Welfare THL had supported restrictions on movement to try and slow the spread of coronavirus, but several ministers rejected the health officials' view.
Some pointed to statements from local hospital district officials that took a different tone as evidence that the issue was not clear cut.
""It's more difficult to evaluate the issue because experts are not in agreement over the necessity of curfews, for example there have been different opinions from the Helsinki University hospital district (HUS),"" said Justice Minister Anna-Maja Henriksson (SPP).
Earlier in the day Prime Minister Marin had said that people should reduce contacts as spring moves in.

More people want to move
Business daily Kauppalehti reports on a survey by Nordea on remote working during the pandemic. According to the survey, an increasing number of people are prepared to move further away from their jobs.
Six percent of respondents said they were willing to move further from their place of work. The figure was up from just two percent a year ago.
""While the figure is still relatively modest, the increase suggests that we may be on the brink of a broader shift. Knowledge workers may not have to live in growth centres in the future, which may have an effect on urban development,"" said an economist at Nordea.
The pandemic has also had an impact on real estate sales, as the number of real estate transactions in Finland increased by almost 10 percent in 2020 last year.
Easter grass livestream
Finland's biggest circulation daily Helsingin Sanomat has a story on the Finnish Easter tradition of growing ryegrass. Ryegrass seeds in small pots ahead of Easter, and when the grass has grown, it is usually trimmed to an even height and decorations such as plastic chicks and hens, bunnies and eggs are placed on the grass.
The Lutheran Church of Vantaa has come up with the ultimate pandemic challenge: how many seconds can you spend watching a livestream of Easter grass growing?
""Following the livestream can add a meditative practice into your daily routine. You can take deep breaths and consciously calm yourself while watching it,"" said the parish press release.

Nappy waste
Helsingin Sanomat also reports on the environmental impact of disposable nappies. A study in the Pirkanmaa region found that around 17 percent of household waste was unrecyclable. Around half of that consists of nappies and sanitary products.
Eveliina Asikainen, a lecturer at Tampere University of Applied Sciences, said that the region's demographic structure has an impact on the type of waste created.
Asikainen estimates that about six percent of all municipal waste in Pirkanmaa is made up of adult incontinence products, while roughly three percent of it is from children's nappies.
""In nursing homes, up to 90 percent of the waste may be adult nappies,"" Asikainen said.
Katri Laatikainen, a researcher working at LUT University and LAB University of Applied Sciences in Lappeenranta is working on a new innovation to create biodegradable adult nappies.
She believes that it is possible to make nappies from biodegradable materials, such as pulp-based raw materials from the forest industry. However, more work and research on the effort is still required."

Finland suspended administering the AstraZeneca vaccine last Friday after two cases of brain blood clots were diagnosed in two individuals who'd received the jab.
At the time, health officials said the vaccine would be suspended for one week, but underscored that the move was a precautionary measure.
""Quantitatively, the suspension will not have a major impact at this stage. If and when the AstraZeneca vaccinations are continued, the stored vaccines will become available again,"" Kontio said in an interview on Yle's Radio 1 on Wednesday.
The AstraZeneca vaccinations have been paused while an investigation is being held into its possible side effects.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also conducted an investigation into the matter and has said it considers the vaccine to be safe and effective.
According to Kontio, Finland's suspension of the jab has created extra work for municipalities due to booked vaccination appointments having to be cancelled.
As of Tuesday 23 March, 13.3 percent of the Finnish population had received at least one coronavirus vaccination dose of some type.

'Open water' (Finnish: selkä) is an expanse of a large lake which is distant from the shore and also clear of any nearby islands or other obstructions.
The conditions for the creation of an ice wall on the lake occur about once a decade, when the ice is thick enough and there are large variations in the daily temperatures.
As the temperature on the lake can fluctuate by as much as twenty degrees within 24 hours, the huge ice sheet expands and contracts with the changing temperature.
As the ice melts, it creates a chasm, but when it freezes again and expands, it forces the edge of the chasm upwards, creating the 'wall' effect.

The private mental health services firm found itself at the centre of a hacking and blackmail scandal after it emerged that highly sensitive information on thousands of patients had been stolen from its database.
The founder and former CEO, Ville Tapio's parents also had some of their assets frozen in a temporary seizure order by the court last autumn.
The asset seizure is related to a majority purchase of the company by private equity investor Intera Partners for around 9.9 million euros.
The Tapio family owned the company until it was bought by Helsinki-based private equity firm Intera Partners in May 2019, not long after a second breach of the psychotherapy provider’s data security systems.
Intera Partners petitioned the court to seize the Tapio family's assets via its holding company, PTK Midco.
The holding company alleges that Ville Tapio knew about the data breaches, but kept the information secret from the potential buyer. Tapio has denied this allegation.
PTK Midco contends that no transaction would have taken place if the buyer had been aware of the breaches.
Wednesday's seizure order extension means that the assets will remain frozen until the dispute is resolved.
However an appeal can still be made to reverse the order. The actual dispute is to be resolved later in arbitration.

The verdict in the case is pending until the assessments are carried out. The court will then decide if the defendants are innocent, guilty or deemed to be not criminally responsible at the time of the suspected murder.
The three suspects are accused of murdering the 16-year-old in the Koskela district of Helsinki last December. They also face other charges in relation to the case, including nine counts of assault and one robbery charge.
The psychiatric assessments will take at least two months and will examine whether each of the accused understood the consequences of their actions.
If they are found to have acted with diminished responsibility, a subsequent prison sentence in the event of the defendants being found guilty could be reduced by up to a quarter.
The court ordered the three defendants to remain in custody, where they have been held in pre-trial detention since 10 December. The final results of the assessments are not expected to be ready for at least three to four months.
Prosecutors demand lengthy prison sentences
According to the prosecutors in the case, the three accused lured the victim to the Koskela Hospital area on Friday, 4 December with the intention of subjecting him to a violent attack. Police uncovered evidence during the pre-trial investigation that the victim had been assaulted at the same location on each of the three previous Friday evenings.
On 4 December, the victim was subjected to a brutal, cruel, and humiliating ordeal for up to four hours, prosecutors stated. The three defendants eventually left the victim lying on the ground at the scene. His body was discovered by construction workers on the morning of Monday 7 December.
Prosecutors are demanding 12, 11, and 9.5 years prison sentences for each of the three defendants on the charges of murder as well as for the prior assaults and related charges.
Court: Defendants committed acts of violence
The court’s interim ruling added that it has been possible to prove in court that the defendants committed acts of violence against the victim on the evening of Friday 4 December.
According to the court, the youngest and oldest defendants were mainly responsible for hitting and kicking the victim several times, including striking him while he was lying on the ground.
In addition, one of these two defendants also hit the victim with a metal pipe and dropped it twice on the victim’s upper body. This defendant is the oldest of the three accused, for whom prosecutors are demanding a sentence of 12 years in prison.
Prosecutors have demanded an 11 year jail sentence for the youngest defendant.
The court further noted that the third defendant also punched the victim twice in the face and helped to carry him from one of the crime scenes to another. This defendant left the scene during the course of the evening, but later returned.
Defence denies intention to kill
All three deny the charge of murder. Two of the accused have admitted to being guilty of aggravated assault and aggravated involuntary manslaughter, while the third admits only to committing assault.
According to the defendants’ defence team, the correct punishment for the aggravated crimes of assault and involuntary manslaughter is about four years in prison, while the assault should receive a less than two years suspended sentence.
The defence added that the defendants did not intend to kill the victim.
The court will later make a judgment on the involvement of each of the accused and how the seriousness of the violence affects their sentencing.
Police investigating role of authorities
The case has sparked a discussion about school bullying as well as Finland’s child welfare system, as the victim had been bullied throughout primary school, according to the findings of an Yle investigation.
The victim had also been a client of child protection services, after he moved outside his home last autumn at the request of his parents.
Despite the three prior assaults on the victim before the events of 4 December, his plight was not noticed by authorities.
Helsinki police have therefore launched a preliminary investigation into the actions of the authorities in relation to the case, although a crime is not suspected at this stage."

Use of the AstraZeneca vaccine was suspended last Friday after two cases of brain blood clots were diagnosed in two individuals who'd received the jab.
""There is no increased risk of the very rare blood clotting disorders after vaccination in people over 65 years of age, of which the possible association with the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine is currently being investigated. Vaccinations for this age group can therefore be continued as normal,"" THL's chief physician Taneli Puumalainen wrote in the press release.
The National Vaccine Expert Group (KRAR) said on Tuesday that the continued use of the AstraZeneca vaccine on people over 65 is medically justified.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also conducted an investigation and said it considers the vaccine to be safe and effective.
""Research into whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship between the vaccine and these rare cases is still ongoing,"" head of THL’s vaccine unit Hanna Nohynek told Yle.
""Although the continuation of vaccinations is very important in the current epidemic situation, possible cases of adverse reactions need to be investigated very carefully. If a cause-and-effect relationship is established, we are also looking at ways to further reduce the risk.""
The agency had said earlier on Wednesday that the temporary suspension of the vaccine had not significantly affected Finland's vaccination rate.

However, there still has not been an agreement among the ruling parties on whether the lockdown legislation should be brought in.
Finland draw in first World Cup qualifier
Finland were held to a 2-2 draw at home against Bosnia and Herzegovina on Wednesday evening as they kicked off their campaign to qualify for next year's World Cup Finals in Qatar.
Teemu Pukki scored both Finnish goals, continuing his hot streak in front of goal, but the Eagle-Owls had to settle for a share of the points after the visitors equalised with a late goal. Finland's next game will be against Ukraine on Sunday.
The match prompted a bit of a social media storm when Left Alliance MP and noted football enthusiast Paavo Arhinmäki tweeted a picture from the stadium, just minutes after he had been earnestly debating expected new lockdown rules in parliament.
There were no fans in the stadium because of the pandemic, but Arhinmäki said he was working for the leftist paper Kansan Uutiset.
Arhinmäki's colour piece rails against the rules of the draw, which meant Finland's group now contains Bosnia Herzegovina and Kazakhstan rather than Estonia and Belarus.
Estonia and Belarus are ""winter countries"", and FIFA said only two could be in the same group. But now Finland will travel to Kiev in March for a match that will likely be played in temperatures close to zero.
Vaccine haul found in Italy
Tabloid Ilta-Sanomat reports on a story about a horde of 29 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses discovered in Catalenti near Rome in Italy.
On Wednesday, AstraZeneca stated that of the 29 million vaccines, 16 million were meant for the EU countries, and 13 million were for the global south through the COVAX initiative.
According to the EU's joint vaccine procurement programme, Finland's share of the giant vaccine discovery is 1.23 percent, or 196,800 doses.
AstraZeneca stated the vaccines will be delivered to EU member countries by the end of April.
Use of the AstraZeneca vaccine was suspended in Finland last Friday after two cases of brain blood clots were diagnosed in two individuals who'd received the jab.
However, on Wednesday the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) released a statement saying Finland will resume administering the vaccine from next Monday, but only to people over the age of 65.

Yle also understands that the restrictions would be effective for three-week periods at a time, and renewed if deemed necessary, up until 14 May.
Parliament is expected to debate the proposal on Friday.
The submission to parliament comes after the parliamentary groups of three of the government’s coalition parties — the Swedish People’s Party, Green Party and Left Alliance — decided to support the bill after each holding marathon talks on Wednesday evening.

The draft bill proposes that people would be prohibited from leaving their homes except under certain circumstances.
Exceptions include:
Going shopping for groceries and other essentials, such as fuel, as well as trips to the pharmacy.
Going to the bank and post office.
Going to work, running a business or entrepreneurial effort.
Managing and attending medical and social care matters and visits, such as going to doctor's appointments, or managing official matters.

Travelling to a secondary residence.
The draft proposal also allows for children aged 12 and younger to play with each other outdoors.
However, in areas where such legislation is in effect, all people born in the year 2007 or before will need to wear protective face masks in indoor public spaces, such as on public transportation and in buildings used by the public.
Individuals who fail to comply with mask requirements could face fines of 40 euros.

The legislation is aimed at limiting the spread of Covid-19.
The National Police Board said on Thursday morning that if the planned law goes into effect, compliance will be monitored around the clock. Law enforcement officers may ask anyone moving around in a restricted area for an explanation of their movement. This can be given verbally or by showing documentation.
The government is seeking parliamentary approval for a law that would temporarily restrict freedom of movement in the Helsinki metropolitan area and Turku, which have by far the highest coronavirus infection rates.
""Police will use case-by-case assessment""
According to the draft text, leaving the courtyard or grounds of one's home would be prohibited, with a wide range of exceptions.
These are to include trips to grocery stores and pharmacies, to work or school, and to holiday homes.
""There are several points in the bill whereby movement would be allowed. Based on the draft text, it is not yet possible to give an exhaustive list of grounds for necessary movement, but the police will use case-by-case assessment in assessing these grounds,"" Deputy National Police Commissioner Sanna Heikinheimo said in a statement from the National Police Board.

€40 fine for not wearing a mask 
Violations of the restrictions on movement may result in fines.

""Primarily, the police will try to carry out enforcement through giving advice, prompting or orders, but if necessary, fines will also be imposed. It is good that there will be clear sanctions for violating the restrictions,"" Heikinheimo said.
Enforcement is to be handled using current police resources. Monitoring units would be set up by the police departments of Helsinki, Eastern Uusimaa, Western Uusimaa and Southwest Finland.

She said it is possible that police officers could be transferred from other areas to assist in the restricted areas.
However, assistance from the Finnish Defence Forces will not possible in this situation. Last spring FDF troops took part in monitoring the borders of the Uusimaa region when movement in and out of the area was restricted.

In a press release (external link) published on Thursday, the association announced that the responsibility for national collective agreements will be transferred to a new employers' association called Teknologiateollisuuden työnantajat (roughly translated as Technology industry employers).
The new association will begin operations in August and Technology Industries of Finland will cease all labour market negotiation activities at the same time.
The updated structure means that member companies can choose whether to participate in nationwide collective bargaining negotiations through the new association.
Companies that do not wish to join the new collective bargaining association will in future negotiate working conditions directly with employees on a company-by-company basis, while retaining membership of the original association.
""The goal has long been that working conditions could be agreed more within companies. Now we really are in a situation where companies are allowed to decide their own tailor-made solutions,"" the organisation’s chair Marjo Miettinen said.
Focus on lobbying, support for non-collective members
In the future, Technology Industries of Finland will focus on influencing labour market policy and supporting member companies that enter into company-specific agreements.
""We believe that by increasing our position, we are best able to ensure success in international competition and thereby improve employment and the well-being of Finland as a whole,"" Minna Helle, the association’s Executive Director of Industrial Relations, told Yle.

Helle added that the objective is not to change collective bargaining or to weaken working conditions, but to give member companies more options. Helle served as the National Conciliator of labour disputes from 2014 to 2018.
Technology Industries of Finland has about 1,600 member companies, which are responsible for about half of Finland's exports, and comprises five subsectors; information technology, the electronics and electrotechnical industry, mechanical engineering, the metals industry, consulting engineering.

One person is suspected of transporting people by plane from Athens to Lappeenranta, eastern Finland, and onward through Helsinki Airport to Berlin. The suspect has been imprisoned in Austria for similar crimes and is also suspected of crimes in Germany.
According to the preliminary investigation, the suspect was generally paid 3,000 euros for false documents and flight tickets. Finnish authorities have interrogated the suspected ringleader remotely in Austria.
Names of other 2 suspects uncertain
In addition to the main suspect, investigators allege that at least two other individuals were involved in the scheme. They are currently known to be abroad. According to the head of the investigation, their apparent names are known but there is some uncertainty about them.
The investigation was launched in February 2020, when the Coast Guard's Turku Crime Prevention Unit found an asylum seeker who was among those brought illicitly into Finland. The asylum seeker is not in detention.

Meanwhile, there are 120 municipalities where both chairs are male.
This is despite the fact that in the last municipal elections in 2017, more women were elected into municipal councils than ever before. Women currently make up 39 percent of all councillors.
Article continues after graph

The information is based on an Yle survey sent to 293 municipalities. Yle received a response from 288 municipalities, and the information for five municipalities was taken from the municipalities' websites.
Altogether there are 309 municipalities in Finland, including 16 in the autonomous Åland Islands, which are mostly small.
According to Yle's report, there is a clear gender division in municipal politics in certain parts of Finland: in large cities, municipal leadership tends to be more female-dominated, while in small municipalities most of the leading decision-makers are men.
The larger the municipality, the more women councillors and chairs there are. In cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants, up to two-thirds of chairs are women. In municipalities with less than 10,000 inhabitants, the leadership is male-dominated.
Threat of harassment may discourage women from running
Marianne Pekola-Sjöblom, Head of Research at the Association of Finnish Local and Regional Authorities, says the gender division can be explained through two things: the number of women who run for office and political power relations.
Last autumn, the Association of Finnish Local and Regional Authorities investigated the reasons that affect people's willingness to run for office in municipal elections.
The desire to run for office is reduced due to personal reasons, said Pekola-Sjöblom. Many of those with families feel they do not have enough time for politics when their lives are already filled with family life, work and hobbies. The threshold for entering politics may be high for women, who often bear the main responsibility of childcare.
Another reason that women might not want to go into municipal politics might be fear of sexual harassment, said Pekola-Sjöblom.
""Harassment and intimidation have been a growing phenomenon in recent years. It reduces women’s enthusiasm to go into politics.""
Municipal researcher Jenni Airaksinen is concerned that the threat of harassment will erode democracy if it puts people off from even running for office.
""Politicians realise that the more prominent their role is, the more they are harassed. It should not be a case where only those with particularly thick skin end up making decisions on behalf of everyone else,"" Airaksinen said.
The next local elections have been postponed from April to mid-June."

Under the current schedule, vaccines are to be distributed equally to the rest of the population once the three main priority groups--healthcare workers, the elderly and people with underlying health conditions--have been vaccinated.
The Helsinki and Turku regions have had much higher infection rates than the rest of the country in recent months.
Speaking at a press conference on Thursday afternoon, Prime Minister Sanna Marin (SDP) said that the government considers it important that the groups most at risk from the virus remain the primary priority.
""The groups currently deemed most at risk should be vaccinated in accordance with the current vaccination schedule throughout the country,"" Marin said. ""After they have been vaccinated, the jabs can be targeted to the worst-hit areas. The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health are responsible for making this decision.""
Lockdown legislation submitted to Parliament
At the same press conference, Marin also confirmed that the government on Thursday submitted a draft proposal to Parliament on temporarily restricting freedom of movement and introducing a mandatory face mask order in areas where the epidemic is ""spreading rapidly and uncontrollably.""
The proposed restrictions would only apply to the Helsinki metropolitan area as well as Turku, where coronavirus infection rates have been the highest. The measures would affect five cities: Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa, Kauniainen and Turku. They have nearly 1.4 million inhabitants, or roughly one quarter of the population of the country.
Parliament is expected to debate the proposal on Friday, but it is unclear whether it could take effect before the four-day Easter holiday weekend.
Marin said that the objective of the restrictions is to reduce unnecessary social contacts, but not to make ordinary life unreasonably difficult. It will therefore continue to be possible for people to carry out essential tasks, such as going to food shops or the post office.
""I appeal to each of you; together we can reduce contacts to what is necessary. This means that we should not invite a couple of friends to dinner or arrange children’s birthday parties.... Parties or unnecessary gatherings need to be suspended to make summer better for all of us,"" Marin said.
Salminen: A calm situation can get out of control quickly
Speaking after the prime minister, THL Director of Health Security Mika Salminen said Finnish authorities had closely followed the situation in other countries, including Ireland and Portugal, where a relatively calm situation got out of control very quickly and endangered health care capacity.
""If intensive care units become overwhelmed, we are then automatically too late,"" Salminen said, adding that THL estimates the proposed restrictions will reduce social contacts by about 25 percent."

""We have to take measures to encourage people to go to work. Today we have unfilled jobs and hundreds of thousands of unemployed people.""

The restrictions will take effect this weekend and continue for at least a month in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus. They will not affect school transport, taxis or other forms of transport carrying 10 people or less.
According to Traficom's Deputy Director-General for Transport System Services, Jarkko Saarimäki, the restriction applies to both public transport and to privately operated transport for limited groups of customers, such as chartered buses. The restrictions also cover the ferry to the Suomenlinna islands.
""The pandemic situation in the Helsinki metropolitan area is so serious that it is necessary to limit the number of passengers. The toughest possible means are now being used,"" Saarimäki said.
The immediate effect is expected to be modest, as mass transit ridership remains low compared to pre-pandemic levels. However, some buses were crowded last week during a two-day walkout by local train drivers, for instance.
""Due to the need to secure services, the maximum permitted number of passengers may be momentarily exceeded if necessary,"" Saarimäki said.

To minimise the risk of exposure in such situations, it is particularly important to emphasise hygiene measures such as the use of masks and hand cleaning, he added.
Similar restrictions in Turku – but not Lahti
Traficom ended up with tougher restrictions than initially considered. According to Saarimäki, the original proposal was for restrictions only on routes deemed to have the highest risk, but instead passenger numbers will be halved in public transport throughout the entire Helsinki metropolitan area.
On Tuesday, Traficom announced similar restrictions for Southwest Finland, including the city of Turku, which has had the highest infection levels besides the Helsinki area in recent weeks.
Prime Minister Sanna Marin (SDP) had called for the number of public transport passengers in the greater Helsinki region to be limited due to rising increasing rates.
According to Saarimäki, the matter has been discussed with health authorities and transport operators. Traficom's decision was ultimately based on a recommendation by the Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District (HUS).
The restriction also does not apply to air traffic, to sleeping cabins on night trains entering or leaving the Helsinki region or to private transport used by people belonging to the same household.
On Monday, Traficom decided not to limit the maximum number of passengers allowed in the Päijät-Häme region, which includes the city of Lahti, even though the Päijät-Häme Joint Authority for Health and Wellbeing had requested such a restriction.

Helsingin Sanomat asks what the restrictions could mean for some small businesses in the capital, which will be able to stay open despite the lockdown rules.
""It sounds catastrophic,"" barber shop owner Nina Snäkä tells the paper. ""We're not being ordered to close, even though customers won't be able to come.""
The draft legislation presented to Parliament on Wednesday would prohibit residents of Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa, Kauniainen and Turku from using services like restaurants (with the exception of takeaway and delivery), hotels and personal services like barbers and beauty care.
Lapland cabins sell out
Elsewhere, tabloid Iltalehti reports on the rush to spend Easter in Lapland.
While the government's proposed restrictions would prohibit residents of the affected areas from travelling to rental cottages and cabins, they would be able to travel to their own. It’s thought that the rules will not be in place before Easter, however.
""Demand has been 30 to 35 percent higher than during a typical spring,"" Juha-Pekka Olkkola of holiday rental firm Lomarengas tells Iltalehti. His company has rented out all but 50 of its 1,000 holiday cottages over the Easter weekend.
The late rush to spend Easter in Lapland won't make up for the loss of foreign visitors, Iltalehti reports, and local tourism bosses are urging Finnish visitors to act responsibly.
""Although masks are not obligatory in Finland, they will be in use in Levi. There will be no parties organised here. This is not a hope but a direct instruction on how this will work in Levi,"" Visit Levi CEO Yrjötapio Kivisaari said.
Exit strategy
Oulu-based Kaleva is among the papers reporting on the progress of the government’s strategy on returning life to normal post-pandemic.
Citing information seen by local news publisher Lännen Media, Kaleva claims that an exit strategy could be on ministerial desks as soon as next week, although it could be delayed until after Easter.
The strategy, led by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, would use criteria including the progress of the vaccination programme, the rate of new infections and seasonal variations in the pandemic to take decisions on lifting restrictions, Kaleva writes.
The news follows a Ministry of Education and Culture working group proposal published on Monday, which set out a potential path to lifting restrictions on public events.
Drivers stick to winter wheels
Tampere local Aamulehti reports on the outcome of a very different piece of government legislation: the rules governing winter tyres.
This winter marks the first since new rules were introduced giving drivers the ability to judge for themselves whether or not winter tyres are necessary when driving.
However, a survey by the VTT technical research centre in February found only four out of 1,200 cars checked in Tampere, Pori, Helsinki and Espoo were running on summer tyres.
That’s the same proportion – 0.3 percent – that was found during a similar survey carried out in 2018, while the old rules were still in place, Aamulehti writes.
According to survey leader Jouko Lahti, the snowy conditions this winter could have prompted drivers to stick to the deeper treads.
""The situation could have been different had this winter been as mild and snow-free as the last one,"" he told the paper."

The process will involve 241 fuel assemblies comprising 128 tons of uranium being loaded into the reactor's pressure vessel. The fuel originally arrived onsite in 2018, plant operator TVO said.
The company said regular electricity generation at the plant would begin in February 2022.
Long delays
The OL3 reactor has been beset by delays. Originally intended to start generating electricity in 2009, the reactor’s start date has been pushed back repeatedly by issues including faulty components and safety tests. The delays led to lawsuits between the plant operator TVO and its builder, the French firm Areva.
Once completed, the OL3 reactor is expected to produce around 14 percent of Finland’s electricity.
Its sister reactor, Olkiluoto 2, made headlines in December 2020 after an emergency shutdown caused by warm water entering the reactor's cleaning system."

After taking a test for the virus last week, the worker allegedly used correction fluid to modify the ""Covid-19 positive"" section of the paper certificate.
According to information received by Yle, the person went to their workplace before obtaining the test result, and may also have attended private events in Levi.
Yle understands that a criminal report about the matter has been filed with police in Kittilä. However, police have not confirmed that the complaint is under investigation.
Individuals receive coronavirus test results both on paper and electronically via the Omakanta online service. Information about positive test results is also shared with health authorities and the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL).
Fines, up to two years jail possible
Kittilä's chief physician Heidi Tanninen said that any suspected forgery would be a serious matter that would be up to the police to investigate.
""If quarantine and isolation regulations are violated in some way then someone could get sick, and at the very worst could suffer a serious illness or even death. This is a serious matter for an individual,"" she said.
According to Minna Kimpimäki, professor of criminal law at the University of Lapland, conviction for forgery usually carries a punishment of a fine or up to two years in prison, although the harshness of the sentence could be affected by the circumstances of the offence.
""The significance of these documents and their intended purpose would certainly impact on the severity of the punishment,"" she said.
Last month's school ski holidays saw tourists account for half of Lapland’s coronavirus cases. Officials in Kittilä say that there have been cases of quarantine rules being broken in the municipality.
""People may not be aware that they can still infect others with coronavirus even if they themselves are asymptomatic,"" Kittilä doctor Tanninen said. ""They may be infectious for as much as a couple of days before the symptoms begin to show. Quarantine is a risky time in that sense."""

Negotiations are slated to begin in April and would cover 1,200 people working in Stockmann's stores and support functions in Finland.
The company said that the move was prompted by the negative economic impact of tightening coronavirus restrictions.
While Stockmann's online store continues to operate, the company said the aim was to reduce the number of staff working in store in anticipation of tighter coronavirus restrictions that would prevent customers from shopping in person, as well as offsetting the loss of revenue caused by the pandemic.
In February the struggling retailer announced a round of codetermination negotiations covering around 900 staff, while earlier in the month Helsinki District Court approved plans to restructure its business in order to pay off debts of over 740 million euros."

The government has issued a list of regulations in its legislative draft, but in an effort to make them more user-friendly, Yle has interpreted the rules in a question-and-answer format.
As the proposed restrictions have not yet been approved by MPs, they could still change. When, exactly, the rules would go into effect — as well as their planned duration — also remains unknown.
Outdoor activities and leisure
Who can you meet indoors and at home?
In general, people living in the locked-down regions will only be permitted to meet members of their own household in indoor situations. However, those in ""established relationships"" who do not live in the same household will be able to meet. Another exception includes caring for a person with disabilities or the elderly.
Can I have a party?
Kind of. As written, the rules say that only people from your household would actually be permitted to attend. In other words, the only ones who could join in the party are those who live in the same home.
Can I travel to a rented cottage in Lapland or somewhere else in Finland?
People can only travel to cottages or leisure homes if they, or someone from the same household, own them or have already rented them for an extended period.
Renting a cottage for a week does not qualify for the exception. Only people from the same household are allowed to visit the cottage or leisure home.
With whom can I meet outdoors, and where?
As mentioned, people from the same household can meet outdoors together. It will also be permitted to meet with up to two others from another household, meaning that three people can meet outside while maintaining a two metre distance from each other.

Is it OK to take a taxi to the station and take a train to another area?
People will not be allowed to travel beyond the regions affected by the heightened restrictions, except to go to leisure homes (see entry on cottage visit rules).
Additionally, for example, people from affected areas will not be permitted to stay at hotels.
All Finnish citizens are permitted to leave and enter the country during the lockdown period. Meanwhile, foreign visitors may only enter the country for essential reasons, but will be able to leave the country.
The Finnish Border Guard has published an extensive guide about the rules for citizens of various countries.
Can I pick up friends in my car if we're going for a walk?
Unless safe distances can be maintained during such a scenario, such situations should be avoided. Keep in mind that people are not allowed to leave regions affected by the lockdown orders.
Can I go to places of worship?
In the traditional sense, no. People in affected areas will not be permitted to gather for religious gatherings. Going to a place of worship will only be allowed on an individual basis, such as to meet with a clergy member on your own.
Shopping and errands
Can I go to the grocery store?
Yes. As foods are considered essential items, it is permitted.
Can I go to alcohol retailer Alko?
As alcoholic drinks are deemed to be foods, yes you can.
Story continues after photo.

Can I buy cigarettes at the kiosk, make-up in shops or plants at the garden centre?
These items are not considered foods nor essential items, so no. But one will be able to buy such items if they're available in grocery stores.
Can I go to the hairdresser or beauty salon?
As haircuts, manicures and similar services are not considered necessities, the answer is no.
What about takeaway food?
You can pick up restaurant food but it must be ordered in advance. Home delivery of meals is also an option, as food couriers are carrying out their jobs, so it is allowed.
What happens if a home appliance breaks, can I go get parts or a replacement?
Visits to hardware stores are OK if an essential appliance has broken or needs a replacement part, if the matter cannot be taken care of later.
Children and relatives
People 13 years of age or older (born in 2008 or later) are allowed to play outdoors with other kids. Children are also permitted to move about outside to take part in hobbies. A guardian, older sibling or other relevant person is allowed to monitor the child or children, taking into account safe distancing measures.
Can kids from divorced families travel to other regions or homes to meet their parents?
Children will be allowed to travel between their parents' homes as arranged, for example every two weeks. An adult who lives with the child (or children) may escort them to another home or residence without breaching the temporary restrictions.
Who is considered a close relative? Who's allowed to care for others and what about funerals?
It will be permitted to help and support children, even if the person helping isn't a blood relative. Grandparents may also take care of their grandkids.
If a close relative becomes ill, you can help them.
Additionally, it will be permitted to arrange and attend funerals.
Property and vehicle maintenance
Will it be OK to maintain properties, a building or vehicle?
Yes. It will be possible to visit a property or building in another location. Buildings, vehicles and the like may be serviced or repaired, according to the draft version of the rules.
Is moving house permitted during the lockdown?
Moving from one residence to the same or another region is permitted. It remained unclear on 26 March whether friends or relatives would be allowed to help people move. However, hiring workers from a moving company will be permitted."

Previously, Pirkanmaa District Court found Aatu Viljami Halonen, 20, guilty of soliciting murder and Mika Markus Aleksi Hytönen ,19, guilty of carrying out the act.
The case marked Finland's first murder-for-hire trial that was arranged online and the fourth hired killing conviction in the country in two decades.
In January 2020, Tampere police found the body of a 44-year-old man in his home, after his neighbors reported an assault taking place outside between the killer and the victim.
After arresting the suspect, police uncovered evidence the case was in fact a contract killing, ordered by the victim's son.
Hytönen confessed to having killed the victim but claimed that he only intended to rob him. The court heard that he told his fiancé he had fantasised about taking another person’s life for some time.
Dark web advert
In 2019, Hytönen posted an ad on the Tor internet network—which facilitates anonymous and encrypted online communication—offering his services as a hit man, asking to be paid in Bitcoin.
Hytönen turned Halonen into police. According to the prosecution, the motive for the hit was possibly financial, but its roots lay in the victim's treatment of the defendant as a child.
The fee for the killing, said to be 10,000 euros, was to be paid from the inheritance left behind by the victim. Through his lawyer Tomi Borgenström, Halonen continues to deny his part in his father's homicide, claiming to have been framed.
The sentencing took place nine months after Pirkanmaa District Court found then-19-year-old Hytönen guilty of murder, and 20-year-old Halonen guilty of soliciting murder. Both were ordered to undergo psychological evaluations at the time. The results were presented in court Friday morning, and both defendants were found fit to stand trial.
The verdict and sentences can still be appealed."

In the debate on Friday, Prime Minister Sanna Marin (SDP) told MPs that the proposed laws were unavoidable.
""In the regions with the worst epidemic situation, we need a sufficiently comprehensive restriction that would significantly reduce contacts between people,"" said Marin.
Even so, the laws will not be approved before the four-day Easter holiday.
MPs are not sitting in Easter week, so parliament is unable to vote on the bill before the holiday. The next possible date to decide the matter in parliament would be Tuesday 6 April.
Parliamentary committees, however, will continue to handle the bill throughout the week.
On Thursday the government submitted a proposal to parliament with which it can propose a temporary restriction on freedom of movement, as well as implement mandatory use of masks in areas worst hit by the corona epidemic.
Secretary General of Parliament, Maija-Leena Paavola, told Yle earlier that the proceedings would take too long for the laws to be taken into effect before Easter.
Interior minister Maria Ohisalo (Green) echoed her sentiments on Thursday night’s A-Studio, saying that there would be a rush to implement the laws before Easter.
The laws would severely restrict movement in areas worst-hit by the pandemic, with the measures expected to be in force in the Helsinki area and in Turku initially.
In Friday's debate PM Marin was also asked whether Finland had decided to focus incoming vaccine doses on the areas worst-hit by the pandemic, rather than vaccinating the whole country at an even pace.

The proposed service would offer support in three Sámi languages, tailored to individual cultures. The service would be available to all Sámi living throughout Finland.

""We will probably have to buy in providers of more demanding services and rehabilitation, as well as interpretation,"" she added.
The commission, expected to take years, is intended to address the injustices experienced by the Sámi, to find out what happened to them and how it has affected them.
Psychosocial support was one of the conditions of the TRC's founding, as it will deal with traumatic experiences and sensitive issues experienced by the Sámi.

However, respondents to the survey rated their own financial situation as the best-ever, with the highest measurement recorded since records began in 1995.
Consumers regarded March as a good time for saving, but poor for taking out a loan or buying durable goods, Statistics Finland said. Despite this, many survey respondents still indicated plans to borrow money within the next year, with plans to buy or renovate a home a common factor.

The survey, carried out by HS, elicited 196 responses, most of which concerned properties built in the capital region since 2010.

Regions remain uncertain
Later on Sunday, the government is to issue a separate decree on which areas will be affected by the closure of restaurants.
According to preliminary information received by the STT news agency, the restaurant restriction situation is to remain unchanged in most parts of the country. The exception would be Southern Ostrobothnia, where restaurants could be opened as the pandemic situation has improved to baseline.
Changes may also be coming to Northern Savo, where restaurants may have to close due to the deteriorating situation.
Up until now the closure has covered nearly the whole country, i.e., the areas that are in the so-called acceleration and community transmission phases of the pandemic.
The only areas that are in the lowest baseline phase and thus apparently not affected are South and Central Ostrobothnia, North Savo, North Karelia and Kainuu.

Opposition MPs criticised the bill for including all restaurants, bars and cafés in the same category, ranging from lunch-only restaurants to karaoke bars and nightclubs.
The opposition also called for a reduction in VAT on restaurants and a more regional targeting of closures, as well as more subsidies for the sector.
In addition, the Finns Party and the National Coalition Party want to allow restaurants to sell alcoholic beverages to take-away customers as a way to help restaurateurs make up for some of their financial losses.

He made the suggestion in an op-ed column published in the leading daily Helsingin Sanomat on Sunday, entitled ""Arctic Cool and the Spirit of Helsinki"".
Niinistö suggested that such a meeting could be a way to defuse what he sees as growing tensions among major powers such as the United States, China and Russia.
In the essay, he asks rhetorically how a constructive dialogue could be established in the meantime, replying that ""the most workable model…is the process launched by the Paris Climate Agreement. We have an important issue in common. The necessary results must be achieved at the Glasgow climate summit [in early November]. The Climate Coalition of Finance Ministers, which Finland co-founded and continues to lead, has its own promising track,"" the president writes.
Arctic issues ""cool enough""
In the article, Niinistö reiterates his proposal for an Arctic summit. According to the president, such a meeting would be useful not only in climate matters but also in relieving military tensions in the region. Niinistö writes that he has stated before that Arctic issues are ""cool enough for discussion even in hotter atmospheres"".
In 2018, Niinistö discussed Arctic issues such as black carbon in talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Donald Trump, who had already decided to withdraw the US from the 2015 Paris Agreement, which it rejoined last month. He again raised Arctic matters during a 2019 meeting with Trump.
At that point, too, Niinistö called for “a first-ever Arctic Summit, bringing together the heads of state and government from the eight members of the Council: the United States, Russia, Canada and the five Nordic states”.
50th anniversary of Helsinki Accords?
Niinistö suggested that an expanded summit could be held, for example, in 2025, 50 years after the original Helsinki Accords.
He proposed that a new summit could be held in 2025, half a century after the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in Helsinki.
The 1975 meeting brought together the heads of state of 35 countries in Europe and North America. It was credited with lowering Cold War tensions and led to the establishment of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in 1995.
“In four years' time, the celebration would be a good time to bring the spirit of Helsinki back to the world. Once again, a positive spiral is needed, a precious foundation of the OSCE, respecting the values of freedom, democracy and rights,” the president wrote.
Niinistö, 72, added that he intends to watch a possible new summit from his sofa at home. His second and final term as president ends in early 2024."

Police said they requested that the crowd break into smaller sub-groups of no more than six people, in line with regional restrictions on the size of public gatherings.
This request was mostly complied with by the protestors, police added.
However, police reported later in the afternoon that safety distances and small groups were not adhered to when a number of protestors moved to the pedestrianised area of Yliopistonkatu near the city centre. Police therefore instructed those present to leave the area and arrested two individuals who refuse to comply with the request.

Police Chief Stephan Sundqvist of the Southwest Finland Police Department told Yle on Friday that police supervision of the event had begun in advance via communication with the organisers.
Sundqvist added thatTurku police also held talks with the Helsinki Police Department after a similar event was held in the capital last Saturday. The Helsinki Police Department were criticised over how a group of about 400 protesters were allowed to gather despite restrictions in the region limiting public gatherings to no more than six people.

Finland has followed the twice-yearly 'Daylight Saving Time' custom of switching clocks since 1981, but the European Parliament voted to scrap seasonal clock changes in 2019. At the time, it was proposed that clocks would be changed in 2021 for the last time, an initiative Finland supported.
However, EU member states must still agree whether they will choose standard or daylight saving time and the EU Parliament has said it wants individual countries to coordinate their decisions in order to avoid problems, such as the fragmentation of time zones.
The final decision has been delayed, partly because of the coronavirus pandemic, and the issue was not on the agenda for the Portuguese Presidency of the EU Council this spring.
In a press release, the Finnish government said the majority of people in Finland want to end the practice.

During the same period, the number of babies born to women under 20 years of age has also dropped.
The study found that free contraception provided by municipalities as well as age-restricted morning-after pills available from pharmacies were both significant contributory factors behind the reduction in teenage pregnancies.
The importance of free contraception is clear from the research results, especially to young people themselves, according to Eerika Jalanko, a University of Helsinki doctoral student and primary author of the study.
""The cost of contraception is one factor that prevents contraception being sought or used. The quality and easy availability of services are also important, especially for young people,"" Jalanko said.
Previous studies have produced similar results: in Vantaa, for example, a free contraceptive trial reduced the number of abortions among 15–19-year-olds by as much as 36 percent.
Options depend on local municipal policy
In Finland, municipalities decide independently whether or not to offer free contraceptives to young people. Some municipalities provide all contraceptive methods free of charge, while others offer more limited options.
The length of time that free contraception is provided to young people also varies between municipalities.
""At some level, almost every municipality offers free contraception, but the conditions are very different,"" Jalanko explained.
The study examined the 100 largest municipalities in Finland, and found that about 25 percent offered unlimited contraceptive options to young people.
""Some municipalities, for example, offer the pill for free for three months. It’s a whole different matter than being allowed to choose for yourself [which form of contraception], and if it would be free until you are 20 or 25 years old. It puts young people in an unequal position,"" Jalanko said, adding that progress is being made as more and more municipalities have started offering free contraception in recent years.
Sexual health 'not a political priority'
Jalanko added that she believes all young people should be offered free contraception, regardless of the municipality in which they live.
The availability of contraception to young people is also on the current government's programme for office, which set out plans for a nationwide trial providing free contraception to people under the age of 25.
However, Jalanko believes that in municipal politics, other issues may have taken precedence over sexual health.
""Sexual health has not been seen as a significant or important issue in municipal politics. I think now that this has been highlighted and more research has come, it has highlighted the importance of the issue,"" she said.
Free contraception schemes can also bring savings to municipalities, as visits to health care and specialist care decrease as abortions are reduced.
However, every prevention of an unwanted pregnancy is important specifically for the young person involved, Jalanko added.
""In the case of the young people themselves, it is a significant factor. If one unwanted pregnancy is prevented, it really means a lot,"" she said."

But this could change, if the two nations decide to finance works including track electrification and the renewal of a railway bridge across the Tornio river.
One big step in the process will take place on 1 April, when the station in the Swedish border town of Haparanda reopens for passenger trains after a 29-year break. The reopened station will offer connections to long-distance trains to the south.
In Lapland, it is thought that restoring the train link between Finland and Sweden could open up new opportunities for tourism. Before the pandemic struck, the popularity of international train travel was growing, due in part to environmental concerns.
Connecting the region
""We have heard from tour operators in central Europe that there are customers who would be interested in travelling here overland,"" says Nina Forsell, executive director of the Finnish Lapland Tourist Board.
The Finnish government decided to electrify a 20 kilometre stretch of track between Laurila, near Kemi, and the Swedish border in June last year. In July 2020 the government received a 1.6m euro grant from the European Union to develop the project.
The city of Tornio has expressed the hope that the area would receive a commuter train link to Oulu, connecting there to long-distance trains in the same way that travellers on the Swedish side will soon be able to do.
""This is a basic requirement for connectivity in the region,"" says Sampo Kangastalo, development director for the city of Tornio.
""Secondly, when services are centralised, people have to travel to get to educational institutions, hospitals and other public services, and rail transport is a very ecological way of doing this,"" he adds."

A final decision on the closure order will be made at the beginning of this week so it can be signed as a temporary law amendment goes into effect on Wednesday, according to Southern Finland's Regional State Administrative Agency (AVI) communications director, Johanna Koskela.
AVI's order will be valid for periods of two weeks at time, in this case likely from 1-14 April.
Koskela said that while the gym shutdown affects businesses in the HUS area, other hospital districts in Finland are also debating whether to take similar action.
On Sunday, Parliament approved a temporary amendment to the Communicable Diseases Act, giving regional authorities the power to temporarily close gyms and other recreational facilities in the areas worst hit by the epidemic.
The amendment clarifies Article 58g of the Communicable Diseases Act, which recently caused differences of interpretation between the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health and regional government agencies.
The temporary amendment is to be in force until June 30.
""Dramatic blow""
The Communicable Diseases Act applies to sports and athletic facilities, public saunas, swimming halls and spas, dance and choir venues, community theatre facilities, amusement and theme parks, indoor playground facilities as well as public lounge areas in shopping malls.
The tightening of rules means that indoor sports facilities in the region like private gyms, which have been operating with a 10-person user cap, may also be forced to shut down temporarily.
The looming closure order will force the facilities run by the Vantaa Gymnastics Club to shut down, according to the club's chair, Elina Yrjänheikki, who noted that the situation was a dramatic blow to the sector.
""Yes, I understand the health measures, but so far the gym and other sports activities have been organised safely, so that there have been no incidents. The number of people [at facilities] has been well controlled,"" Yrjänheikki said, adding that she was particularly concerned about possible restrictions affecting children under the age of 12.
""I hope at least that the restrictions will not apply to people under the age of 12. It will be really unfortunate if that's needed,"" she said.
Previous coronavirus-related restrictions have led to a reduction in participants at the gymnastics club by around 40 percent and also significantly reduced the need for staffing, according to the club chair.
""If yet more regulations are issued, it will mean a total stop to everything,"" Yrjänheikki lamented."

The proposed suspension of Tytti Yli-Viikari, the auditor general of the National Audit Office of Finland (VTV), now goes to parliament's Chancellery Commission on Tuesday.
However, according to Yle's information, the Chancellery Commission is unlikely to make a final decision on Tuesday as Yli-Viikari will be given time after the meeting to prepare a possible response.
Tabloid Ilta-Sanomat reported last week (external link in Finnish) that Yli-Viikari spent some 4,729 euros of public money on hairdressing and beauty services between 2018 and 2020.
The paper also reported that there were questions over the auditor general's use of an agency credit card to cover other personal expenses as well as her travel costs. An Yle investigation has revealed that Yli-Viikari's travel expenses were the highest of all 55 heads of Finland's state agencies.
Warning led to investigation
In January, Iltalehti reported on an exceptional termination of employment agreement that resulted in a civil servant being paid a salary for two years on the condition they did no work.
That was the result of an agreement between Yli-Viikari and Mikko Koiranen, VTV's Director of Legal Affairs, which resulted in both civil servants receiving a warning from the Parliamentary Ombudsman.
This led to the Parliamentary Audit Committee announcing that it would begin an investigation into VTV's internal financial and risk management, including the agency's travel expenses.
Finland's Speaker of Parliament Anu Vehviläinen (Cen) said on Saturday that Yli-Viikari's alleged actions undermined the agency's credibility as one of VTV's main responsibilities is to monitor the use of public funds.
Yli-Viikari released a statement over the weekend denying she had committed any crime, but refused to comment further as a preliminary probe into the matter has been launched by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI).
The NBI has confirmed that it is investigating the activities of two VTV officials, but has not revealed their identities.
The possible dismissal of Yli-Viikari from her position would ultimately be decided by a plenary session of Parliament. In practice, this decision would only be made after the Chancellery Commission's report on Yli-Viikari has been completed, which is likely to be after Easter.
Yli-Viikari's six-year term as Auditor General is due to end later this year."

Wahlroos, the chair of both financial giant Sampo Group and forest industry firm UPM-Kymmene, is a shareholder in at least five Luxembourg-based companies, three of which he is listed as the owner. Wahlroos has also invested in British payday loan company Auden Group Limited, according to the data.
Hundreds of Finnish firms and individuals have engaged in tax haven asset management in Luxembourg, according to an investigative report by Yle MOT, which reviewed the list.
Other Finns who have moved financial assets to Luxembourg include Ilkka Herlin, an heir to the Kone fortune but not involved in the family business, former Nokia chairman Jorma Ollila, former CEO and President of Sampo Kari Stadigh and the Ehrnrooth family.
While the database also includes mafia-owned companies and businesses associated with money laundering, there are currently no signs of disreputable dealings at the hands of the Finns mentioned in the story.
A European tax haven
Luxembourg has long been seen as a more ""acceptable"" tax haven than Panama or the British Virgin Islands. The ability for corporations to make favorable agreements for the purpose of seeking tax relief, a system that favors profit shifting and the discretion offered by the country has made Luxembourg appealing for many investors.
In the Grand Duchy, with a population of just 600,000, nearly 90 per cent of businesses are currently owned by non-Luxembourgers.
European Parliament member Eero Heinäluoma (SD), who functions as a substitute on the subcommittee of Tax Matters, described the findings of the database as ""shocking"".
""Luxembourg has been caught engaging in questionable financial activity in the past. The country has promised to change its practices, and, to some degree, it has,"" Heinäluoma told Yle, adding that some of these practices have been replaced by new ways to avoid taxes, resulting in loss of revenue across the European Union.
""Luxembourg is not doing this in a vacuum, their actions affect the other 26 member states. The loss of tax revenue is in the ballpark of a billion euros,"" explained Heinäluoma, adding that he hopes members of the European Union will band together to fight for increased transparency.
""When some refuse to contribute, others have to compensate for the loss. With increased awareness the pressure toward these countries will build and their practices will become unsustainable,"" he said."

Meanwhile an expert from the Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) told Yle that the Helsinki and Uusimaa hospital district could receive twice its current quota of vaccines if the change were to go ahead.
Speaking to Yle A-Studio on Monday night, STM's director, Jari Keinänen, said the ministry was making preparations for a change in policy.
""We will assess whether it is possible to proceed on the basis of THL's guidance and the current legislation, or whether the government's decree on vaccinations should be changed to take this forward,"" he said.
According to Keinänen, officials would prefer to avoid having to make changes to the current vaccine legislation. The ministry will find out this week if such changes are necessary, he said.
""If there is demand and the government moves forward on the basis of the current decree, then we will begin transportation [of the vaccines] as soon as possible,"" he told A-Studio.
Change would mean boost for capital area
While governing parties the SDP, Greens and SPP have backed the change, experts from THL have been more cautious.
Speaking to Yle, THL expert Mia Kontio said the organisation's reticence was based on legal considerations, as well as feedback from hospital districts around the country.
""The opinions of the hospital districts, which were for the most part slightly negative, influenced the position,"" Kontio said. ""Other questions of fairness had to be taken into account, as well as the issue of whether it was possible legally,"" she added.
Kontio also told Yle that any change would strongly benefit the Helsinki and Uusimaa hospital district (HUS), a region which has regularly seen the highest infection rates in the country.
Regions oppose vaccine prioritisation
Chief Medical Officer Juha Paloneva from the Central Finland Hospital District said that the plan amounted to ""a war on the Finnish concept of equality.""
""Changing the allocation criteria does not address the root cause of the epidemic in certain areas. Not enough people have followed isolation guidance and infection tracing is lagging behind,"" he said.
Paloneva also argued that delays caused by sending vaccines to worse-affected areas might not be an efficient use of resources, as the state of the pandemic varies rapidly from week to week."

The debate has stoked division among the governing parties. Prime Minister Sanna Marin (SDP) told Yle on Sunday that the government was ready to prioritise regions with higher infection rates, but HS quotes Centre Party leader Annika Saarikko as emphasising that at-risk groups ""must be vaccinated equally nationwide.""

Fewer serious Covid cases in Finland
Elsewhere in Helsingin Sanomat, the paper compares the situation in Finland's intensive care units to those in other European countries.
According to the paper, Finland has the lowest proportion of patients in ICU with Covid-19 of any of the 18 European countries monitored by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).
Finland currently has 0.5 coronavirus patients in intensive care per 100,000 residents, HS notes. In the hardest-hit Czech Republic, the figure is 18 per 100,000.
Meanwhile, proportions for Finland's neighbours Estonia and Sweden were 5 and 2.7 per 100,000 respectively.
Pension funds outperformed by Swedish neighbours
Business-focused Kauppalehti reports on a claim by a financial consultant that Finland's pension funds are producing half the income of their Swedish counterparts.
Consultant Sami Villa compared the returns of pension funds in both countries for ten years, Kauppalehti writes. He found that the average return over the ten-year period in Sweden was 141 percent, while in Finland it was 66 percent.
""If the Finnish pension system had performed as well as the Swedish system during 2011-2020, we would have about 77 billion euros more in pension assets right now,"" Villa told the paper.
Kauppalehti says there are several reasons for the difference, among them a tendency for Finnish funds to invest in money markets. There are also higher costs associated with fund management in Finland, the paper writes.

The company has exported pulp for use in Xinjiang, China, a region where the minority Uighur population has faced severe human rights violations and forced labour practices, according to media reports.
Stora Enso's decision to shut down pulp production at its plant in Joensuu came after the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported that most of the chemical wood pulp material used in Xinjiang came from Finland.
According to SCMP, a hazardous chemical process is utilised to transform the pulp into viscose — also known as rayon — a material used in the textile industry.
Production of the material takes place at giant factories operated by the firm Zhongtai Chemical, located very near China's Uighur labour and retraining camps, the news outlet reported.
SCMP noted that since 2017, Finland had exported roughly 311 million euros worth of the pulp to the region, according to Chinese customs data.
International observers and human rights groups have reported on the ill treatment of the minority Uighur population. It is estimated that at least one million Uighurs were currently being held in detention centres, where forced labour and the sterilisation of women occurs.
China has denied the allegations of forced labour and human rights violations.
Abuses called out
In a tweet in February, Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin (SDP), said that China had violated human rights and oppressed minorities, adding that doing business ""was no reason to turn a blind eye to these atrocities.""
Meanwhile, last month, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, decried the rights abuses in Xinjiang. Additionally, the US, Canada and the Netherlands have compared China's activities in the region to acts of genocide.
Stora Enso declined a request by Yle for comment on the story. However, in an email the company's CFO and Finland country manager, Seppo Parvi, stated that the company already had plans last year to spin off its soluble pulp segment for viscose production.
According to STT, the firm said it looked at the matter from economic and sustainability perspectives, adding that the decision to stop production at its Joensuu plant would not affect staff levels at the facility.
In its report, SCMP noted that a Stora Enso spokesperson said company representatives had regularly visited Zhongtai Chemical factories and never saw an indication of forced labour taking place at the facilities.
However, the news outlet noted, the spokesperson said Stora Enso was deeply concerned about the reports of forced labour and discrimination of minorities in Xinjiang."

But the group said agents were increasingly concerned about proposed new restrictions on movement in areas with high Covid infection rates, according to a recent survey.
During the spring season Helsinki and Turku usually see an average of more than 2,000 home sales per month, and those cities are expected to be first to face lockdown rules.
A lot of rental property contracts are also usually negotiated this time of year. The draft legislation on movement restrictions under consideration by Parliament lists moving house as a valid reason to move about in areas to be affected by the law.
However, except in exceptional circumstances, homes aren't sold without visits and inspections of properties, according to the association's CEO, Jussi Mannerberg.
He pointed out that prospective buyers can face major costs if deals aren't completed in time. In worst-case scenarios, Mannerberg said some people could end up without places to live.
Could complicate expected cottage sales boom
If the new restrictions are approved, sales of summer cottages — which have been particularly brisk in recent times — would also be hampered. Sales of holiday homes in Finland last year increased by nearly 40 percent compared to the year before, and prices of such properties are expected to rise by around five percent, on average, according to the association.
""Last year many people who were in the market for a cottage couldn't find what they wanted, so this spring lots of buyers are expected,"" Mannerberg explained in a statement, noting that restrictions on movement would likely significantly delay the summer cottage sales season.
Housing price fluctuations in February were different in the capital area compared to other parts of Finland, according to Statistics Finland.
Prices for residential properties rose by an average of around 3.4 percent in the Greater Helsinki area last month compared to a year ago. Meanwhile, in most of the rest of Finland, housing prices dropped by an average of 0.9 percent. Price increases were recorded in the cities of Tampere, Oulu and Turku, however, according to the number-crunching agency.

Such was the case for Raisa Moukha and Yuri Gippoev, a retired couple who live in the southern Finnish harbour city of Kotka, roughly halfway between the Russian border and Helsinki.
The couple went to their homeland to get the country's Sputnik V vaccine in their home city of Petrozavodsk in the Republic of Karelia in January.
The reason was to get vaccinated more quickly than they would have been able to in Finland.
""It was easier and more readily available,"" Gippoev said, explaining that the couple made an appointment at a Petrozavodsk health clinic.
They received both jabs within three weeks.
""I think we would have had to wait a long time for vaccinations [in Finland]. But we wanted to live more freely and didn't want to wait,"" Moukha said.

The couple said that they have active lives and want life to get back to normal as soon as possible. Moukha said she knows other Russian nationals in Finland who are planning similar trips to Russia for vaccinations.
""My friend is leaving Lahti for St. Petersburg and another friend in Kouvola is heading to Moscow,"" she explained.
The Sputnik V (pronounced as the letter, not the Roman numeral) vaccine received a good deal of international media attention since it began rolling out last year. Russia has also exported the vaccine abroad including to EU states Hungary and the Czech Republic.

Given the global rollout, one might think that Russia's vaccinations are going particularly well. However, this is not the case at the moment.
In St. Petersburg, for example, just over six percent of the population has been vaccinated against coronavirus, according to Tarja Teittinen, service director at the Finnish-Russian Chamber of Commerce in St. Petersburg.
More broadly, less than five percent of people in Russia have received the jabs, according to the Russian government services website gogov.ru, which provides official coronavirus vaccination statistics.
Meanwhile, as of Tuesday about 15.5 percent of Finland's population has received at least one coronavirus vaccine dose. Most of those people are elderly, belong to other risk groups or work in the health care sector.

Like other coronavirus vaccine producers, Russia has faced slowdowns due to production difficulties, as the country does not have the capacity to make large quantities of the vaccines itself. The country has, for example, turned to Germany to mass produce the jabs.
Another reason behind low vaccination rates in the country is that many Russians are suspicious about vaccines, particularly domestic varieties.
""Some take the vaccine, some don't. Vaccination providers have had public relations challenges. Vaccinations have not started easily,"" Teittinen explained.

However, for those that want the jab, it is easier to get vaccinated in Russia than in Finland. While at-risk groups are prioritised in Russia, the vaccinations are not being as strictly distributed to specific demographic groups as in Finland.
In Russia, people can get the vaccines if they're active, according to Teittinen.
She said that there are coronavirus vaccination points in places like shopping centres. Appointments can be booked in advance and some even offer walk-ins, she explained, noting that she has also gotten her coronavirus vaccinations."

The figures revealed that the total number of unemployed people was 220,000, up from 185,000 in February 2020.
The unemployment rate was 8.1 in February, up from 6.9 the year before, with employment among 16- to 64-year-olds standing at 70.0, having been 70.3 in February 2020.
The unemployment rate among men rose by 1.5 percent from February last year to 9.2 percent, while the unemployment rate for women rose by 1.0 percentage point to 7.0 percent.
Statistics Finland's methodology for calculating changes in the labour market was renewed at the beginning of this year, which means that they are unable to publish trend figures.
Statistics Finland explained that this means the data for February 2021 may not be comparable with earlier released data and may be revised at a later date.
Furloughs on the rise
Separately, an employment review from the Ministry for Economic Affairs and Employment found that 72,600 people had been furloughed by the end of February, an increase of 47,700 from the year before.
A total of 55,700 people were full time furloughed, up by 36,900 from February of 2020.
Statistics Finland carries out a Labour Force Survey each month to determine unemployment rates, meaning its figures tend to differ from those used by the Ministry for Employment and the Economy.
Furloughed employees are included in the ministry's numbers, as they have to register to receive income-linked unemployment benefits. Statistics Finland's data only include those who have been looking for work in the last month and are ready to start a new job in the next fortnight.
Statistics Finland produces Finland's official and internationally-comparable unemployment figures."

The H5N8 virus was detected in sick and injured birds in February and early March this year, including in a swan found dead in Helsinki's Eläintarhanlahti park and a goshawk sent to Korkeasaari Wildlife Hospital from Kumpula.
Helsinki's chief veterinary surgeon Päivi Lahti said the avian flu had also been found in other parts of Uusimaa.
""The disease has also been found in birds in Hanko, Espoo and Tuusula. It seems that there is bird flu across a wide area, at least here in southern Finland,"" she said.
The situation is very different to that seen during a previous outbreak of the virus, Lahti said.
""It was not previously present in so many different places in Finland. Last time, the disease was limited to southwestern Finland, but there are now several cases around southern Finland. This is now an exceptional situation for us,"" she said.
Spring migrations likely to spread the outbreak
""There has been quite a lot of the H5N8 virus in birds in Europe. The virus will definitely come along with migratory birds, though the worst-affected will likely die on the journey here,"" Lahti said.
The first case of H5N8 was detected on a pheasant farm in Janakkala in January. Following that discovery, the Finnish Food Authority instituted a ban on keeping poultry outdoors, effective from 8 February.
""The bird flu virus is not easily transmitted to humans and being infected usually requires close contact with a wild bird, poultry, or their secretions,"" the authority said in a statement.
However, it was reported in late February that the virus had spread to humans, when seven workers at a poultry plant in southern Russia were infected. Authorities said that the virus was not passed from person to person."

The feat was achieved in the open water of a lake near the city of Heinola, in southern Finland.
The French national swam a distance of 120 metres under water while holding his breath for about three minutes, without any extra oxygen or diving fins.
The five-time world champion of the sport was wearing a two-millimetre-thick wetsuit and swimming goggles while diving in the two-degree water. Nine holes were drilled in the ice along the route to ensure the diver's safety.
Guérin-Boëri's achievement has yet to be formally confirmed by Guinness World Records.
The world record for diving under ice has now changed hands three times in just over a month. First, Czech diver David Vencl set a new world best in February when he swam just over 80 metres in a time of two minutes and 42 seconds at a disused quarry near Prague.
Then, Finnish diver Johanna Nordblad broke Vencl's record on 18 March, when she swam 103 metres under the ice of a lake in the Kainuu region. Nordblad's record lasted less than two weeks before Guérin-Boëri broke it.
Vencl wore only swimming trunks and goggles for his record dive, while both Nordblad and Guérin-Boëri wore wetsuits.

The research found that people with sleep disorders recover more slowly on their days off, and up to half can be constantly tired even in their free time.
Researcher Päivi Vanttola from TTL, who worked on the study, emphasised that it was important to nail down the causes of insomnia.
""Just like day workers, shift workers' insomnia and fatigue can be caused by an underlying illness, life situations or stress at work,"" Vanttola said.
Shift work prompts disorders
Vanttola's study found that many shift workers suffer from insomnia or chronic fatigue and if the issues persist, they can develop into Shift Work Sleep Disorder (SWSD).
The study also found that people with SWSD were less relaxed before bed, took longer to fall asleep and had a lower quality of sleep than those who did not have the disorder.
According to the study, working just three late or overnight shifts a month can contribute to constant fatigue, even outside of working hours.
Aorund one-in-five people in Finland have jobs requiring shift work and unusual working hours are becoming more common
In 2015 the European Working Conditions Survey found that 27 percent of women and 19 percent of men in Finland regularly carried out shift work
""Minimising the number of night and early morning shifts and providing sufficiently long recovery periods can alleviate the symptoms for many people with shift sleep disorders,"" Vanttola said."

According to the paper, the explosion in the number of taxi operators in Finland since the market was liberalised by the Juha Sipilä (Cen) government in 2018 opened the way to some unscrupulous operators.
Marko Myllyniemi, director of control and supervision at the tax administration Vero said that over 1,300 new operators had failed to register their business with authorities.
Myllyniemi also confirmed to Iltalehti that 400 such companies would be subject to audits this year.
In Helsinki authorities inspected 111 cars and found 77 of them to have faults, the paper writes. Some drivers were also found not to have taxi driver licenses.
One issue that makes the taxi industry so ripe for exploitation, Iltalehti says, is that cash payments can be impossible for authorities to track.
""Consumers can make a difference. If you pay in cash and agree not to get a receipt, that only enables the bad operators,"" Myllyniemi told the paper.
""Dark store"" opens in Finnish food delivery expansion
The pandemic has been a good time to be in the delivery business, as people have increasingly taken to ordering food and goods online to reduce time spent out and about.
Pirkanmaa local paper Aamulehti covers the mechanics of how this change is taking place, with a story on a so-called ""dark store"" opening in Tampere.
The store, opened by food delivery company Foodora, carries 2,000 products including milk, toilet paper, toothpaste, meat and vegan items, the paper writes. Its purpose: to compete with supermarkets by offering grocery deliveries within an hour.
""It’s made possible by a large crew that is constantly circling around the city,"" Foodora development director Anni Ahnger told the paper.
The speed is also a result of strict targets: the six warehouse staff are expected to pick and pack a customer's order within five minutes – workers at the company's dark store in Helsinki's Pasila take just two minutes on average, according to Aamulehti.
Majority backs prioritising vaccines by region
Lastly, a poll in Helsingin Sanomat suggests that a majority of people support prioritising vaccine distribution in areas worst hit by the coronavirus – with a portion saying it should only be done after at-risk groups have received their jabs.
The survey found that 38 percent would begin prioritising high infection-rate areas immediately while 36 percent said hard-hit areas should get the jabs after at-risk groups were vaccinated. Just 22 percent of respondents were against the plan, with 4 percent saying they were unable to respond.
People in metropolitan areas most strongly backed a change in vaccine distribution, HS writes, with those in rural areas least in favour.
Breaking down responses across political lines, supporters of the Finns Party were most opposed, followed by Centre Party voters, the paper reports.

Speaker of Parliament Anu Vehviläinen (Cen) announced the decision during a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, explaining that the commission wants to calm the commotion that has engulfed the agency since details of Yli-Viikari's expenses and travel claims became public.
""There have been many negative remarks about the activities and use of money by the auditor general, including among citizens, in public and in Parliament. The auditor general's activities have significantly weakened the agency's credibility and position as the ultimate supervisory authority of public funds,"" Vehviläinen said.
The statement came after the Chancellery Commission discussed the matter at a meeting earlier on Tuesday, following a recommendation from the speaker's office on Monday that Yli-Viikari be suspended from her position pending the outcome of a formal investigation.
Commission ""not convinced"" by explanations
Vehviläinen emphasised that the National Audit Office of Finland must exercise particularly good judgment in the use of public money, but the commission was not convinced by the answers provided by Yli-Viikari in relation to the ambiguities on her use of agency money.
The commission hopes that Yli-Viikari will refrain from performing any official duties while the investigation is ongoing, Vehviläinen added.
The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) has previously stated that it has launched a preliminary investigation into VTV's operations.
Ilta-Sanomat reported last week (external link in Finnish) that Yli-Viikari spent nearly 5,000 euros of public money on hairdressing and beauty services between 2018 and 2020.

At a media briefing held by the Green Party on Tuesday, Ohisalo responded to comments by THL's CEO Markku Tervahauta in Helsingin Sanomat (external link in Finnish). Tervahauta said that the areas worst hit by the epidemic--the Helsinki metropolitan area and Turku--should be given additional vaccines while risk groups are still being vaccinated elsewhere in the country.
However, this was contrary to a THL statement published on 26 March saying that targeting the areas with the highest infection rates would likely not have a significant impact on the progress of the epidemic. THL said this was because by the time there would be enough vaccines to target the hardest-hit areas, there will be enough to vaccinate the greater population.
""I have to say that there have been very contradictory messages from THL over the past week. This puts us politicians in a difficult position,"" Ohisalo said, adding that the conflicting information will make it difficult for decision-makers to reach a sound conclusion.
The interior minister further said that she would like more information about the effectiveness of changing the vaccination order.
In an interview with Yle, Tervahauta said that vaccinations can only be increased in the worst affected areas when there are more vaccines available than at present.
A clear vision is needed for government negotiations 
The government is due to discuss plans to alter the vaccination strategy during a meeting on Wednesday.
It is essential that expert organisations provide the government with clear expectations prior to negotiations, Ohisalo said, so that the government can be on the same page as THL about desired outcomes.
""If targeting vaccines to hard-hit areas is the most effective measure, according to THL estimates, I expect a presentation tomorrow from healthcare experts on what will work best, because politicians need to have access to the most accurate data in making big and difficult decisions,"" Ohisalo says.

The study compared the likelihood of hospitalisation for coronavirus in vaccinated and non-vaccinated patients.
The results largely reflect the efficacy of a single dose of the vaccine, as only 10 percent of the study's participants had received a second dose during the study period.
""Estimates of vaccine efficacy are in line with results internationally. Four weeks after receiving the first dose of the vaccine, efficacy was 78 percent in Israel, 81 percent in Scotland and 71-80 percent in England,"" said Tuija Leino, head of the immunisation programme at THL.

In particular, respondents aged 18-34 said the crisis had caused feelings of strain and exhaustion.
The survey found that the epidemic and related restrictions had burdened residents of all ages.
However, feelings of social isolation were particularly common among young adults under the age of 25, with more than 40 percent of that group saying isolation had negatively affected their wellbeing.
Conversely, respondents over the age of 65 were least likely to say they were burdened by feelings of isolation.
One aspect about the pandemic most respondents had similar feelings about — regardless of age — was a fear of contracting the virus. But only about one third of all respondents said that fears about falling ill had impaired their emotional health.
Beyond circumstances of the crisis itself, respondents said they had negative feelings of uncertainty about the future, work related issues, their health as well as financial and livelihood concerns.
Women were more likely to feel burdened by the crisis than men. Female respondents said they worried about the crisis and their families significantly more than their male counterparts.
Changing attitudes
Nearly two thirds of younger respondents also said they had experienced mental health issues in themselves or within their immediate circle of friends. That proportion was exactly the same as in a similar survey carried out by the association four years ago, according to the group.
The most common psychological problems those respondents cited was exhaustion (46%) or depression (40%). As many as three quarters (75%) of respondents under the age of 25 said they had experienced exhaustion themselves or in someone close to them.
Anxiety was also common among younger adults, with two thirds of people under the age of 35 saying they or someone they knew had dealt with symptoms of anxiety.
The mental health advocates said that results of this survey were similar to a previous survey it carried out, in that young adults are increasingly feeling burdened in general.
However, a clear change from the survey four years ago was improved overall attitudes toward mental health.
In 2016, just under half of respondents said that attitudes about mental health had improved in recent times. In this year's survey, 59 percent shared such sentiments. Meanwhile around 66 percent of women noted a positive change in attitudes about mental health issues.

A country often cited for its egalitarianism, Finland's current vaccine policy involves rolling out the jabs to the elderly and at-risk groups across the country. However, some say the country should instead target the vaccine in areas with the highest infection rates.
On Tuesday Interior Minister and Green Party chair Maria Ohisalo criticised the health agency for contradictory signals about the vaccination scheme.
Tervahauta has suggested that areas worst hit by the epidemic— the Helsinki metropolitan area and Turku — should be given additional vaccines while risk groups are still being vaccinated elsewhere in the country.
However, a few days before that the agency Tervahauta leads, THL, issued a statement that said targeting vaccines would not have a significant impact on the epidemic.
In an interview with Yle on Wednesday, Tervahauta said the conversation about the policy had become politicised.
""Since the issue is regionally and politically relevant, it becomes a political decision,"" he said.
The national vaccine expert group KRAR also supports a readjustment of the country's vaccination scheme, saying the priority change should take place even before all risk groups get their jabs.
Risk groups and vaccines
Meanwhile, Markku Mäkijärvi, chief physician at the Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District (HUS), agrees with the expert group.
""Helsinki residents with diabetes face a 30-times greater risk of contracting Covid-19 than people in other parts of the country. Changing the vaccination scheme could reduce cases by 20 percent. You put out forest fires where the flames are,"" he said, adding that the changes should be made quickly, as they would affect the third wave of coronavirus.
""If we wait until all risk groups are vaccinated, it will be late May. Then we can't affect the third wave anymore,"" he explained.
According to a survey by daily Helsingin Sanomat, the majority of Finns said that areas hardest-hit by the epidemic should get more vaccines.
THL chief Tervahauta noted, however, that changing the vaccination plan should be done while taking logistical and equitable treatment concerns into consideration.
The logistical issues include matters like the Pfizer-Biontech vaccine requires storage at -70 degrees Celsius, and that isn't possible in all areas. Meanwhile, the vaccine manufacturer needs to know where the jabs are to be delivered three weeks before they ship.
Jabs and restrictions
""The faster you make a decision, the faster you can change the distribution,"" Tervahauta said.
Currently — and ever since the epidemic started in Finland — the densely populated region of Uusimaa, which includes Helsinki, has seen the highest number of coronavirus cases in the country, accounting for just over two thirds of all cases. The region has also seen the highest need for Covid-19 medical treatment.
HUS chief doctor Mäkijärvi said that a change in vaccine distribution would benefit all of the country, not just Uusimaa, because many new coronavirus cases in other parts of the country originate from Uusimaa.
Nevertheless, Tervahauta said that the best measures to curb the spread of infections were following restrictions and recommendations issued by authorities. He noted that vaccinating risk groups means they will be protected from serious illness for the time being, but how the vaccinations will affect the epidemic overall will only be seen later on.
""A combination of carefully implemented restrictions as well as vaccines will take us towards a brighter spring,"" Tervahauta said."

The panel handed over its report to Minister of Economic Affairs Mika Lintilä (Cen) on Wednesday.
According to the government programme, the energy use of peat must be at least halved by 2030 due to its high greenhouse gas emissions. The proposals will next be considered by the cabinet.
The working group called for a one-off waiver package for companies in the sector.
It also recommended partial state compensation paid to peat producers for unsold stock, the purchase of privately owned or leased peat production areas by the state forest agency Metsähallitus and the establishment of a panel to set compensation levels for disposing of peat production equipment, among other measures.
1,700 jobs at stake
Adjustment allowances should also be paid to entrepreneurs who halt peat production, and early retirement options for older entrepreneurs should also be clarified, the committee said.
In December, the Bioenergy Association of Finland estimated that some 1,700 people were directly employed in peat production and transport, primarily in northern Finland.
The working group also proposed support for the transition of peat companies to new businesses, which could be partly funded by the EU's Just Transition Mechanism (JTM).
The JTM, which is part of the European Green Deal, ""aims to alleviate the social and economic costs resulting from the transition towards a climate-neutral economy"", according to a European Commission statement. It has a budget of 17.5 billion euros.
Dirtier than coal
As part of the government's emissions-cutting programme, the use of peat as energy is to be at least halved by 2030. Burning peat for electricity emits more carbon dioxide than coal.
The centre-left cabinet has pledged that Finland will achieve carbon neutrality by 2035.
It has predicted that the use of peat as an energy source will end in the 2030s due to the higher cost of the emissions allowance, although ""it will remain in use to ensure security of supply"".
The cabinet has promised to overhaul the taxation of peat as part of a general energy tax reform.
Instead of incinerating peat, the government aims to increase its use in ""innovative, high added-value products"" in a manner that is ""fair at the regional and social levels"".
According to Statistics Finland, the use of peat as an energy source fell by nine percent in 2019 to just four percent of total energy consumption.

The approval followed heated debate among council members about the almost five-year-long project, which exceeded original cost estimates by well over 100 million euros.
The funding decision called for an equal contribution from the Finnish state. So far, the city of Helsinki and the national government have split the costs equally.
The price tag for renovating the 1938 stadium, which reopened in September last year, hit almost 338 million euros. Helsinki's decision to contribute a further 37,936,500 euros brings the maximum amount the city will pay for the building work to just over 168 million euros, rather than the 130 million previously decided.
European football pushed up costs
Increased security measures requested by European footballing body UEFA were a factor in pushing up the cost of the renovation, said Helsinki Deputy Mayor for the Urban Environment Anni Sinnemäki (Green).
""We can be proud that, together with the state, we have renewed such a historically significant building,"" she said.
""Of course, it's easier for costs to rise in such a unique site than it would be in a new-build, for example,"" she added.
Helsinki City Manager Sami Sarvilinna, who presented the additional funding request to the council, said not all of UEFA's requirements had been known when the original budget was drawn up.
""The association updated its requirements after the initial budget,"" Sarvilinna said.
Audit office criticised renovation process
In January the National Audit Office of Finland (NAOF) issued a report criticising the stadium renovation project, saying ""the state aid process from decision-making to granting was not appropriate in all respects.""
The NAOF also found that supervision of the renovation by the Ministry of Education and Culture ""did not meet the requirements of the complex, long-term project.""
""The steering group appointed for the project failed to manage the costs of the project appropriately,"" the body wrote."

The Social Democratic Party (SDP) of Prime Minister Sanna Marin dropped from first to third place in March, falling behind the main opposition blocs, the Finns Party and the National Coalition Party (NCP).
The race at the top remains tight, with the three parties fighting a close battle for first place in the delayed municipal elections, set for 13 June. The differences in their support fall well within the margin of error of two percentage points.
Yle's poll found that the Finns Party has regained its spot as the most popular party with 19 percent support, but the gap between it and the second-place NCP is negligible.
The third-place SDP is also still within striking distance, but in recent surveys it has been trending downwards.
SDP support fell the most
The SDP started the municipal election campaign as the most popular party when pollster Taloustutkimus carried out its first municipal election survey of the year in January. The main governing party's support declined in both February and March.
In March, the downturn steepened at a time when the debate over proposed anti-coronavirus measures such as restrictions on movement was at its most heated.
Three out of five governing parties publicly criticised the restrictions on movement, which were strongly pushed by PM Marin, and suffered a major setback in Parliament on Wednesday.
Tuomo Turja, Research Director at Taloustutkimus, which conducted the poll for Yle, suspects that the debate surrounding pandemic measures may also affect municipal election support.
""This survey measures municipal election support, but the elections have been postponed and the parties have not yet launched their campaigns. So this may reflect a more general political debate about what has been going on recently,"" Turja said.
Improved support for the National Coalition Party bodes well for them in the municipal elections. The NCP, which hopes to regain its position as the largest municipal party, can traditionally rely more on its voters to turn out than the Finns Party can.
""The NCP is in a positive situation in that it has loyal voters. The NCP can trust that the poll results will be realised in the election. The Finns Party has more challenges in this respect,"" Turja said.
Left support slips to Greens
Coming in behind the top three are the Centre Party and the Greens, who are nearly neck-and-neck. In March, the Greens saw the strongest rise in support for any party.
According to Turja, the Greens have won support from the Left Alliance, whose support has fallen. A bounce in support for the Left in February fizzled in March.
""The Left Alliance has lost supporters, especially among women, young people and people living in southern Finland. The Greens have gained supporters among the same groups,"" Turja said.
Support for Centre, small parties unchanged 
Support for the Centre Party remained stagnant. Turja said that many former Centre voters remain on the sidelines and have not indicated which party they intend to vote for this time.
""At the moment, it is of paramount importance for the Centre that they get their potential supporters to the ballot box if the party wants a reasonable result in the municipal elections,"" Turja said.
At 12.5 percent, support for the Centre is currently five percentage points lower than in the last municipal elections in 2017.
The results of those elections were a big disappointment for the Centre at the time, but now the party would exceed all expectations if it were to repeat its 2017 performance.
Support for the Swedish People's Party has not shifted at all, although its leader, Justice Minister Anna-Maja Henriksson, was heavily criticised for postponing the municipal elections.
Support for the two smallest groups in Parliament, the Christian Democrats and the Liike Nyt movement, likewise remained almost unchanged.
According to Turja, the approach of the municipal elections is reflected in the fact that the popularity of groups outside Parliament increased slightly in the support survey.
Taloustutkimus interviewed 2,463 eligible voters between 8 March and 30 March. Of these, 1,617 stated a party preference. According to the company, the margin of error is two percentage points."

'Zombie' fish startle onlookers in Oulu
Rural affairs-focused Maaseudun Tulevaisuus reports on an unusual phenomenon in Oulu caused by a parasite brought to Finland by accident.
Nature photographer Veera Kalevaleinen told the paper how she spotted a large number of fish jumping and twitching on top of the ice off Oulu's Toppilansaari.
""It looks pretty wild when there's an endless number of fish jumping on top of the ice,"" she said. ""It was pretty shocking.""
What makes the phenomenon more unusual, Maaseudun Tulevaisuus writes, is that the fish are dead. Despite this, they hop onto the ice and continue to bounce, twist and jerk, the paper reports.
""The parasite appears to have arrived in Finland via a cargo ship's ballast tank,"" expert Jaakko Viheltäjä of the Finnish Museum of Natural History told MT.
""We don't think they pose an immediate danger to humans. However, I personally would not touch them with bare hands,"" he added.
Winners and losers
Tabloid Ilta-Sanomat focuses on inequality in the Finnish property market with a review of a new book on the subject by financial journalists Karla Kempas and Veera Tegelberg.
The book, A Finland of Winners and Losers, argues that during the last decade property values in big cities began to diverge sharply from those elsewhere, IS writes, dividing people into winners and losers, depending on where they live and whether they own property.
According to Ilta-Sanomat, the book compares the case of a woman in North Karelia who attempted to sell her apartment for years, eventually offloading it at a significant loss to that of a man who bought a property in Helsinki in the mid-1990s and now finds himself with a home worth 1.7 million euros.
The article quotes Finnish Confederation of Professionals (STTK) economist Antti Koskela, who says the government should aim to support the growth of cities across the country as rapid growth in big cities raises house prices and increases regional divides.

The government is to immediately submit a proposal on the matter for a round of comment, ministers said on Wednesday evening.
The comment process will last until 13 April, so there will be no imminent change in the sequence of vaccinations.
The government wants to partly adjust the emphasis on vaccinations according to the infection situation in various parts of the country.
This would mean that once risk groups and those over 70 years of age have received the first dose of vaccine, THL could distribute some vaccine batches in a targeted manner.
The institute would be able to consider the number of infections and people in intensive care when deciding on the distribution of vaccines, in addition to the population of each area.
Under the plan, the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) would be able to distribute portions of individual vaccine batches based on the population of the hospital district, the number of infections in the previous two weeks, and the number of those in intensive care in the previous 14 days.
The Uusimaa region, which includes Helsinki, and the southwest, including Turku, have had by far the highest infection rates over the past year.
Regional targeting possible from mid-April to late May
The proposal was drawn up by the THL and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health. The government will send it for comment as it stands.
Cabinet ministers will then decide on possible amendments to the bill after it is circulated for comment to various agencies and committees.
According to the proposal, the order of vaccination would be changed permanently in regard to age groups, but the regional targeting of vaccines would only be possible through the end of May.
Following vaccination of risk groups, social and healthcare staff and the elderly, other individuals would be vaccinated across the country by age group, starting with the oldest.
After those over 70 years of age, vaccinations would be given to people in their 60s, then those in their 50s, 40s, 30s, and finally those aged 16-29.
Saarikko: Working-age population to be vaccinated by age group
The bill would also expand the ranks of those allowed to administer shots. At present, vaccinations may only be given by doctors, nurses and midwives who has received appropriate vaccination training. In the future, dentists and healthcare students would also be able to administer jabs.
Minister of Science and Culture Annika Saarikko, who is also chair of the Centre Party, commented on the government's change in the vaccine order on Twitter on Wednesday evening:
""The basis for this has been prepared by the ministry and the THL. Feedback and impact assessments on regional weighting will be heard. The main point in the draft regulation is that the working-age population throughout Finland will be vaccinated by age group,"" she wrote."

On Wednesday, the committee, which must approve all bills, ruled that the restrictions on movement proposed by the government are unconstitutional.
Following the ruling, Prime Minister Sanna Marin (SDP) said that the government would withdraw the bill. In a tweet, she said that a special cabinet meeting would be held on Wednesday evening to formally rescind the legislation.
Marin also said on Twitter that the pandemic situation remained serious and that close contacts should be avoided. She advised ""spending Easter only with the people closest to you and avoiding unnecessary travel"", adding that ""we still have to work together to make summer brighter for all of us"".
Rinne: ""Completely disproportional""
According to the committee, restrictions on movement must be targeted precisely at the presumed sources of infection, i.e. private events and parties, moving around in groups and shopping.
The committee pointed out that the prohibitions in the government's bill are subject to interpretation. Therefore, in practice, it would be impossible to predict what is forbidden or permissible.
""The basic solution of the government's proposal to ban movement in principle is completely disproportional and cannot be considered necessary within the meaning of the Constitution,"" said committee chair Antti Rinne (SDP), who was Marin's predecessor as prime minister and party leader.
""The problem is highlighted by the possibility of interpretation in prohibitions, regulations and their exceptions. It is virtually impossible for people to predict what is forbidden and permissible – and thus what is punishable,"" he said.
“Prohibitions and restrictions must be directed precisely at the sources of infection: private gatherings and events, staying and moving around in groups and visiting shops and services – restrictions specifically related to these, rather than prohibitions,” said Rinne.
Purra: Bill must be entirely restructured
The Administration Committee also considered the bill on Wednesday and is to give its verdict on the legislation on Thursday.
The committee's chair, Riikka Purra of the opposition Finns Party, said she believes that the changes demanded by the Constitutional Committee are so extensive that a supplementary proposal will not be enough to correct them, but that instead the government will have to completely restructure the proposal.

Shipyard company RMC says that a new completion date of mid-June has been agreed with Wasaline, instead of May as agreed in the contract.
The new Aurora Botnia vessel will operate on the route between Vaasa, Finland, and Umeå, Sweden.
One in three workers ill
More than a third of the workers at the Rauma Shipyard fell ill with Covid-19 during the late winter and early spring, and the shipyard had to suspend its production almost completely for a week. Since then, strict precautions have been taken at the yard to prevent the epidemic from spreading again.
According to the company, infections were particularly prevalent among foreign workers employed by shipyard subcontractors. Health authorities in the Satakunta region said they suspected that falsified coronavirus test certificates may have worsened the outbreak.
""The pandemic has delayed the delivery of key equipment, among other things. With the June handover, we will be able to ensure that the number of employees working on the ship's finishing and commissioning work can be kept within safe limits,"" said Jyrki Heinimaa, the yard's CEO.
Aurora Botnia's construction work is in the final phase of equipping and commissioning. Wasaline said that the new schedule is understandable.
""Given the globally challenging situation, the new schedule suits us,"" said Wasaline CEO Peter Ståhlberg. The delay did not come as a major surprise to Wasaline, he added.
Until the completion of Aurora Botnia, the 40-year-old Wasa Express will ply the Vaasa-Umeå route.
The ferry order is worth about 120 million euros. Heinimaa said the delay will have financial consequences, but he declined to specify whether the shipyard will have to pay compensation to Wasaline.

30 of the patients in ICU on Wednesday were in the Helsinki and Uusimaa HUS hospital district.
There are 273 ICU beds in Finland, meaning around 100 of them are currently free.
According to data from the National Intensive Care Coordination Office the last week of March saw a slight decrease in ICU patients with coronavirus, although it remains to be seen if the downward trend will continue.
Lessons learned
Despite high case numbers, the load on intensive care units has been lower this spring, as there have been fewer coronavirus patients requiring simultaneous care.
Last April saw the highest number of coronavirus patients in ICU on a single day, 83. The highest number this year was 64 patients, recorded on 23 March.

""Treatment times have been shortened, which means the strain on intensive care units has been better controlled,"" said Stepani Bendel, director of Kuopio University Hospital's Centre of Excellence in Intensive Care.
According to Bendel, the difference can be explained by the fact that we now know more about the virus, and are learning more about how to treat it.
""The cortisone-like dexamethasone is likely to have an impact improving a patient's ability to cope with intensive care. Patients are also being treated with less intrusive methods than before and will not be put on a ventilator if gentler treatments work,"" he said.

Ahead of the government's mid-term review, a two-day round of talks assessing the government's actions so far and its plans for the future, Etla is recommending, among other things, more incentives for investment, as well as reforming social security in order to make it more appealing to work.
""Finland has fallen into the so-called growth trap. Slow growth prospects are not an incentive to investments, which means that growth will continue to be slow. In addition, Finland is weighed down by a zero-interest liquidity trap, where monetary policy makes it difficult to revive the economy,"" said Etla Managing DirectorAki Kangasharju in a press release.
According to the think tank, the development of new ideas and investment came to a halt in Finland during the global financial crisis and the collapse of Nokia cluster. The state became indebted and the situation was exacerbated by an ageing population. Recovery has been further slowed down by the eurozone crisis of 2009 and by the current interest rate crisis.
Etla has suggested that higher education institutions should be given the opportunity to charge tuition fees, because the transition from higher education to the workforce is happening too late.
Work-based migration should be promoted by abandoning needs assessment and speeding up work permit processes. In addition, experts from abroad should be attracted with tax incentives, said the institute's press release.
In addition, Etla highlighted that social and unemployment security should be made more work-friendly. The duration of earnings-related schemes should be shortened, and the amount of support should be staggered. Receiving low-wage and part-time work should be made profitable, together with a comprehensive social security reform. The lowest wages would be offset by income transfers.
The price of housing should be lowered, especially in the capital region, where high housing costs are a problem for those in the lowest-paid jobs."

Politicians could pack courts, says expert
Finland's court system could be abused by an undemocratically-minded government, claims the front page story of Tuesday's Helsingin Sanomat.
The claim is based on an interview with Kari Kuusiniemi, president of the Supreme Administrative Court of Finland.
Current legislation means that Finland's courts could be susceptible to manipulation by politicians, HS writes. One way a government could do this would be to drastically increase the number of judges, appointing loyalists to new positions and forcing older justices to retire, the paper says.
According to Kuusiniemi, the state should launch a study into guaranteeing the independence of the courts as soon as possible, following a similar move in Sweden last year.

Swedish energy company Tibber told Dagens Nyheter that favourable wind conditions brought electricity prices into negative territory. The same phenomenon occurred in Finland, according to Nordic power exchange Nord Pool.
Antti Paananen, head of markets with the Finnish Energy Authority, said this was the first time this year that electricity prices dipped below zero.
""Last year, prices were negative on three occasions, and last February was the first time in history that Finland saw negative electricity prices,"" he said.
 Little direct benefit
Consumers whose power agreements are directly tied to the power exchange will benefit the most from the negative price dip. However, savings are likely to be minimal as electricity distribution prices still apply.
Negative electricity prices are more common in Denmark and Germany, which have more wind power capacity than Finland.
Paananen told Yle current technology does not enable the storage of electricity.

That said, actual recycling levels and those advertised by Fortum don’t add up, MOT found.
Over the past few years, Fortum has said that 75 percent of the household plastic waste it processes is recycled into new raw material--a statement the company still made on its website in January. However, over the past few years, the recycling rate has been significantly lower.
Fortum now reports that in 2019, it managed to recycle some 37 percent of plastic waste arriving on-site in Riihimäki, a figure that has remained largely steady, according to the company. At the Riihimäki plant, household plastic passes through several processing stages, ending in plastic pellets that Fortum sells to manufacturers as raw material.
Kalle Saarimaa, Fortum’s vice president of recycling and waste, denied that the company provided misleading information regarding recycling efficiency, noting that the share of waste repurposed into raw material varies every year.
More supply than demand
Saarimaa said households' enthusiasm to sort plastic waste has outpaced buyer interest in plastic pellets. This has led to low-quality plastic being burned, creating energy used to power district heating systems.
Experts have criticised Finland for urging residents to recycle plastic the country has been unprepared to handle.
Fortum previously said it lacked the capacity to process all of the sorted plastic arriving in Riihimäki, which is why Finland ships some household plastic waste to Sweden and Germany. The company has claimed that transporting plastic long distances is more environmentally friendly than allowing it to degrade in the natural environment.
Saarimaa said he expects Fortum to be able to increase its plastic recycling efficiency to 60-65 percent in the coming years with the introduction of chemical recycling. Fortum also noted that its current recycling level helps lowers carbon emissions. This stance was echoed by a report commissioned by the Ministry of the Environment which also found that a 37-percent recycling rate reduced emissions.
The EU has set a goal of recycling at least half of all plastic packaging on the market by 2025."

HUS Chief Physician Markku Mäkijärvi said the news was like a ray of light on Easter weekend.
""Happily, there's good news there,"" said Mäkijärvi. ""The number of patients in hospital being treated for Covid has clearly declined. In HUS hospitals there were a total of 76 patients being treated this morning, and 20 of them were in intensive care.""
On 31 March there were still 156 patients on Corona wards and 30 in intensive care.
The decline in Corona war usage is a good sign, said Mäkijärvi.
""There are fewer seriously ill patients now,"" said Mäkijärvi. ""Fewer patients are needing hospital treatment.""
That means more people are leaving Covid wards than are being admitted to them, and the load on hospitals is reducing as fewer seriously ill patients present for treatment.
Patients had been transferred to other hospitals as a precaution, so that there would be space for any new surge in Covid admissions.
HUS had expected a spike in admissions over Easter.
""We're glad to be wrong about this,"" said Mäkijärvi. ""Every Covid ward has spare capacity to take new patients.""
Infections down, but so are tests
Finland recorded some 302 new Covid infections on Sunday.
Mäkijärvi says that it's difficult to draw conclusions from one day's figures.
That's because there have been fewer tests than normal. In the HUS region there were around 5,000 tests on Saturday, roughly half the normal number.
""Of course it's possible that the epidemic is fading away, but it can't be the reason for this big change,"" said Mäkijärvi.
""Behaviour around testing is more of an explanation.""
It's likely that there'll be a spike in testing after Easter, if previous holidays are a reliable indicator.
""Test numbers will definitely increase when people return from their holidays,"" said Mäkijärvi. ""How much Covid we diagnose then, will tell us about the pace of the epidemic now.""
Mäkijärvi urges those who've travelled at Easter to go for tests if they have symptoms. That information can then inform decisions about restrictions and recommendations.
""If we don't have accurate information about the extent of the epidemic, we are driving through fog and decisions are not as good as they would be otherwise."""

The facility's cavernous halls require a lot of energy to heat through the long Finnish winter, when elite athletes gather there to practice their skills.
But now the centre, which is based in Ostrobothnia, is hoping to cut some 1,350 tonnes of carbon emissions each year.
That's according to an estimate by contractor Lem-Kem. It's equivalent to the greenhouse gases emitted by a diesel-powered estate car if it were driven around the world 250 times.

The centre's managing director Jussi Töyrylä says that the geothermal investment is part of a plan to make operations carbon-neutral by 2030.
Finland's government has pledged to hit 'net zero' by 2035, and last week announced a plan to end peat-burning for energy in the country.
Over the last decade several changes have increased the centre's energy efficiency. Lighting has been revamped, and solar panels have been installed to meet some 15 percent of the centre's annual electricity needs.

""In total the investments cost a few million, but for example the cost of the geothermal system will with this financing model be repaid within 15 years,"" said Töyrylä.
Töyrylä says that peat-burning will continue on-site this spring and summer next to the centre's car park, but in the autumn the peat-powered heating plant will be shut down.
""Geothermal energy will save as much emissions as around 750 private cars' average annual emissions,"" said Töyrylä.
28 kilometres of pipes
The system works the same as it would in a private house, even though this is one of Finland's biggest geothermal projects.
Whereas for an ordinary detached house just one borehole would be needed, Kuortane will require 104 of them, all drilled to a depth of more than 200 metres.
Altogether, the contractors are set to dig some 28 kilometres of underground tunnels for the system.
In addition to the boreholes, tunnels will allow the heating fluid to circulate, so that it warms a few degrees underground. The liquid reaches some 60 degrees with the help of a heat pump.

Kuortane's Olympic Training Centre is to get a new geothermal heating system. Mårten Lampén / Yle
According to Lem-Kem expert Mathias Kampe, around two-thirds of the energy required is free of charge from the ground, and around a third is produced via electricity.
In the winter, electricity needs to be purchased externally, but in the summer it comes from the some 2,600 solar panels that were installed at Kuortane last year.

Contractors say similar systems could be installed at farms, for example. But the technology has its limits.
""There are exceptions in places where you can't drill, for example where you might hit groundwater, or in tight spaces where there's no space to drill,"" said Kampe.
Boreholes should be drilled at least 15 metres and preferably 20 metres apart.
Automation helps
In addition to heating, lighting is an important energy consideration in large spaces.
Switching to LED lights saved some 760 megawatt-hours of electricity each year at the Olympic Training Centre in Kuortane.
Modern energy solutions get a helping hand from automation these days. LED-lamps can be programmed automatically according to how spaces are used.
In heating systems, automation helps to spot faults quicker.
If heating system filters are blocked, and the system is using more electricity than usual, the problem is spotted immediately. Without the automated system, faults like this would only be noticed during a seasonal service.
Automation can also be set to adjust to weather conditions in advance, so that heat production steps up even before there's a cold snap."

""My friend said 'I am willing to kill if someone in this country is forced to put on a mask',"" Turtiainen wrote. ""Well, I wouldn't just watch that from the sidelines either. Greetings to colleagues who are in favour of a mask mandate.""

Vehviläinen has previously remarked on Turtinen's conduct in relation to the issue of wearing masks after Turtiainen clashed with Deputy Speaker of Parliament Juho Eerola (Finns) earlier this year.
On that occasion, Turtiainen had refused to comply with the Parliament's recommendation on the use of face masks, citing health reasons, which led to a verbal disagreement with Eerola.

Yli-Viikari faces a threat of suspension from her role following media reports that she spent thousands of euros of taxpayers money on beauty services and travel.
The deep distrust of the audit office's management is impacting VTV's staff, Alanko-Kahiluoto said.
""It is therefore not just a matter of Yli-Viikari, but of the entire staff. If the questions are not answered, the suspicion will only grow,"" Alanko-Kahiluoto stated, adding that she finds it difficult to understand why Yli-Viikari does not want to answer, for example, questions that have arisen about her use of flight points.
""If she has not used the flight points, why does she not make her points account balance public? She could easily do it right away, and the doubts would be dispelled. VTV is a key Finnish audit authority, and we should all be able to trust it,"" Alanko-Kahiluoto said.
Papers: Less auditing activity during Yli-Viikari's term
Tabloid newspapers Iltalehti and Ilta-Sanomat (external links in Finnish) both reported on Friday that the core activities of the Audit Office--examining how other government agencies use public money--have significantly decreased during Yli-Viikari's term as auditor general.
In response, Alanko-Kahiluoto said she has not had time yet to delve deeply into the reports.
""That finding has not come to light in the committee hearings, but it is something that may need to be examined separately,"" she said.
Iltalehti reporter Jarno Liski, who has reported on the case for weeks, wrote that VTV's reports have been censored and one member of staff was ordered to destroy an audit report.
""It is really serious if this has happened, and of course it needs to be addressed,"" Alanko-Kahiluoto said.
The Green Party MP has chaired the Audit Committee for two years, during which time the atmosphere at the National Audit Office has become a point of discussion.
""After consulting with staff representatives in the context of VTV's annual report, it became clear that the agency had a poor level of job satisfaction. Various measures have been taken to improve interaction and staff consultation, but clearly not enough,"" Alanko-Kahiluoto said.
Auditing the auditors
Parliament's Audit Committee is currently investigating VTV's internal control and risk management, as well as the principles of good governance within the agency. The report is expected to be completed this month.
At the same time, Parliamentary auditors will conduct an additional, separate audit of VTV's accounts.
According to Alanko-Kahiluoto, the committee's report will contain concrete proposals for improving VTV's internal processes.
""There must be someone who also controls the auditor general's use of money,"" she said.
VTV Director denies allegations
Iltalehti further reported that VTV's auditing activities have generally become more favourable to agencies being audited during Yli-Viikari's term as auditor general.
The agency's director, Mikko Koiranen, told news agency STT that this is not true.
""This is not the case,"" Koiranen said. ""There have certainly been grounds for why the reports and their contents have been modified. After all, the question is how things are to be expressed and used, and what kind of adjectives, when taking a position on an issue. Whether the statements are based on information obtained during the auditing process, or on opinions. The people interviewed in Iltalehti's story have generalised their own experiences to apply to the entire agency's activities.""
Several of Iltalehti's interviewees also stated that the agency had been run on a culture of fear for years, saying that those who question the directors' policies were punished with reduced salaries and additional workloads. Koiranen refused to comment on these accusations.
""There is no reason to start such a public discussion about leadership through fear,"" he said.

The Prime Minister further stated that The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) will need to assess whether the proposed bill's effects can be accurately calculated or modeled. Otherwise, it will be difficult to demonstrate the effectiveness of the legislation.
""The effectiveness is linked to the assessment of whether the proposed legislation is necessary and proportionate.""

Harkimo, a businessman and media personality, said he did not identify with the most famous presenter of The Apprentice, former US President Donald Trump.
""We're quite different people and the only thing we have in common is The Apprentice,"" he explained.
With many careers under his belt, Harkimo told APN ""it's a benefit to be in different areas before going into politics —I don't believe in spending your whole life in politics....I have two former wives who have been in Parliament, so I've been involved with politics for tens of years.""
""Not a mainstream political actor""
With designs of becoming a digital democracy, Harkimo's Movement Now has sought guidance from Italy's anti-establishment Five-Star Movement.
Harkimo said his group wants to offer a fresh alternative to traditional party politics and admitted to spending 700,000 euros to personally finance the endeavour. ""When I get into something, I really want to do it,"" he said of his party which has been boosted by his social media presence.
The Movement Now leader said he did not necessarily see ethical concerns in local elected officials taking product placement deals as social marketers.

Harkimo has drawn criticism over the years for his links to Russian elites under US sanctions through his former pro ice hockey team Jokerit. He sold his ownership in the club in 2019, which meant he served as a parliamentarian while having close ties to individuals suspected of money laundering.

She was found guilty of aggravated animal welfare endangerment, four nature conservation offences, two counts of illegal animal importation and one count of threatening an informant. The court dismissed one further charge for a nature conservation offence.
The woman illegally imported wolves and hybrid wolfdogs to Finland from Russia. She kept the animals at a property in the municipality of Loppi, about 90km north of Helsinki, where they were bred and sold.
According to the prosecutor, the woman mistreated the animals, beating them with her fists, chains, sticks and brooms.

Defendant claimed to have been set up
The crimes were committed between June 2016 and January 2019 in the southern municipalities of Loppi, Orimattila and Karkkila, as well as Vaalimaa, a border crossing point to Russia.
The police investigation began in 2019 after authorities received information about a wolf being kept at a property in Karkkila. The case was investigated by a Helsinki-based police team which specialises in animal welfare-related crimes.
Police quickly became aware that several wolves had been smuggled from Russia to the main suspect's farm in Loppi.
All four defendants denied the charges against them. The main suspect claimed in court that the animals on her property had been put there in an attempt to frame her.
The defence claimed that the animals involved were not wolves or illegal first-generation wolf-dog hybrids. The defence also argued that the animals were not being farmed for profit.

In an interview on Yle TV1's breakfast showYkkösaamu on Tuesday, Kaikkonen said that while the situation was currently under control, there were contingency plans in place.
""If the coronavirus situation at a garrison were to become particularly serious, the barracks could be used to house those infected or exposed, then of course healthy conscripts could be increasingly accommodated in the field,"" he said.
However, such measures have not been deemed necessary so far. Conscript garrisons have been divided into three groups to reduce the number of contacts. In practice, this means that one group lives in the barracks, while another is out in the field and the third group is on leave.
The coronavirus pandemic has not only affected the daily lives of conscripts, but also how the Defence Forces plan to arrange call-ups.
According to Kaikkonen, a proposal that would enable the armed forces to carry out conscript call-up interviews remotely was recently sent to Parliament.

All Left Alliance MPs who responded to the survey said they were opposed to deciding on future austerity measures. Six Green MPS indicated they were opposed, while another six did not take a position for or against.
""It's very difficult to predict how long the coronavirus crisis will last and what the economic impact will be accurately enough to be able to draw up precise guidelines for economic policy for 2023-2029 this spring,"" said Green MP Iiris Suomela.
""Not even the credit ratings agencies have set out specific spending cuts,"" said Central Finland MP Bella Forsgrén (Green).
Two Green MPs, Atte Harjanne and Inka Hopsu, said they supported making a decision on future budget adjustments this spring.
""The government cannot hide behind the coronavirus""
Opposition MPs were almost unanimous in demanding a decision on budget adjustments.
NCP chair Petteri Orpo said the government needed to consider the future during the April framework debate.
""The government needs to present a plan on how to boost employment and the economy, and control government debt,"" he said.
Other NCP MPs said that the rebalancing of the public finances would not be possible without some form of austerity measures.
""Debt cannot be taken on forever and the government cannot hide behind the coronavirus year after year to avoid nasty decisions. We are already halfway through the election season and it's high time the government rolled up its sleeves,"" said Helsinki MP Wille Rydman.
Respondents from the Finns Party said that government borrowing should be curbed and plans made to adjust spending.
""Start adjusting public spending as as soon as possible. Growing debt threatens to weaken Finland's credit rating and raise interest rates,"" said Finns Party MP Sami Savio."

According to the company, roughly 72,000 trips departed from Uusimaa last Thursday.
Data for the same period last year revealed that only 22,000 journeys were made from the region, a difference that can be explained by the fact that Uusimaa was under a travel ban until mid April.
In 2019 the number was 134,000, nearly double this year's figure.
Uusimaa has consistently seen some of the highest infection rates throughout the coronavirus pandemic. In February experts from health agency THL called on the region's residents not to travel to other parts of the country.
Telia's Tiia Palvimo said it was not possible to identify groups or individuals from the data.
""The figures have been extrapolated to cover the entire population, using market share and population statistics. They describe the number of trips that started in Uusimaa each day and continued with stops lasting fewer than 50 minutes,"" she said.
Lapland resorts busy
Despite messages from officials asking them to stay home, many people headed north to make the most of the ski season.
""Yes, the fells are busy, really a lot of people on the move. Fortunately the safety distances are being maintained and masks worn. Perhaps we're learning to stick to the coronavirus rules, and for that I'm very happy,"" said Visit Ylläs CEO Janne-Juhani Haarma.
Data from automatic road traffic measurement points supports Telia's finding that Easter travel did not reach pre-pandemic levels.
The Jääskö measuring station on Route 79 to Levi registered an 11 percent drop in vehicles last Thursday, compared to pre-pandemic levels.
Compared to last year, Lapland's roads were significantly busier. Automatic traffic measuring stations on Kittiläntie registered roughly three and a half times the traffic they did last Easter."

Marco Cavaleri, head of vaccines strategy at the EMA, told Italy's Il Messaggero newspaper that he believes there is a ""clear"" link between the vaccine and rare cases of blood clots reported in people who recently received the jab.
""In my opinion, we can say it now, it is clear there is a link with the vaccine. But we still do not know what causes this reaction,"" he said.
Cavaleri's opinion is therefore not the official position of the EMA, but he added that the agency will be investigating the connection further and an announcement will be made in the coming days.
If the link to blood clotting can be confirmed, it would still be considered an extremely rare side effect. In Britain, about 30 of the 18 million people vaccinated with AstraZeneca by the end of March are known to have developed blood clot symptoms, and seven of them died, according to a report by the BBC (external link).
Finland awaits official EMA position 
Maija Kaukonen, a Senior Medical Officer with the Finnish Medicines Agency Fimea, told Yle that she was surprised by Cavaleri's statement.
""Now that Marco Cavaleri has come out with this in this way, I hope that the [EMA's] risk assessment committee will give its recommendation and views on the matter today [Tuesday]. However, such big decisions are usually not made on the first day,"" Kaukonen said.
The EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) began a three-day meeting on Tuesday to discuss a possible update to the recommendation on the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine.
Cavaleri's statement will have no immediate effect on how Finland distributes the AstraZeneca vaccine, according to Hanna Nohynek, head of the vaccine unit at the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare THL. Finnish authorities will instead wait for an official statement from the EMA before assessing whether the current practice needs to be changed, Nohynek added.
""For the time being, Finland will follow the precautionary recommendation that the use of AstraZeneca be restricted to people aged 65 and over, because no such rare side effects have been observed in that age group,"" Nohynek said.
A number of countries have imposed restrictions on the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine, especially in younger adults."

The draft bill proposed introducing restrictions on people's movements in areas of the country worst-affected by the coronavirus epidemic.
Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, Pöysti said that he did not feel he should have prevented the government from submitting the proposal to Parliament, despite being criticised for his supervision of the proposed bill.
He justified this on the grounds that the government must have the opportunity to make new proposals to Parliament which contain interpretations of the constitution.
Opinions on legislation not unanimous
Pöysti further pointed out that elements of the constitution are often in need of interpretation, and expert opinions on the proposed restrictions on movement were not unanimous.
""There were several statements for and against the proposal, which contributed to the possibilities for interpretation,"" he said.
His office also published a detailed article on the Chancellor of Justice's website (external link in Finnish) explaining the background to the process.
""The government did not act unlawfully, even if the constitutionality of the government's proposal is open to interpretation in the light of previous practice, as well as the Constitutional Law Committee deciding on a different position from the government in its assessment,"" Pöysti wrote.
However, according to critics, allowing the bill to make its way to parliament showed a lack of adequate supervision by the Chancellor of Justice, whose responsibility is to monitor the actions of the government.
Evaluation of old practices 
Pöysti had participated in government negotiations regarding the proposed legislation.
""These long-term practices give the impression that the Chancellor of Justice is a member of the government team, which leads to concerns about whether there will be blindness to what is taking place there,"" Pöysti said at Tuesday afternoon's press conference.
The preparation of the restrictions on movement was made particularly difficult by the perceived urgency, with Pöysti further pointing out that the proposed bill was prepared remarkably fast, even taking the exceptional circumstances into consideration.
Furthermore, the drafting process did not include a consultation round, as is usually the case, which Pöysti said can have a negative impact on the quality of a proposal."

The country is at the height of the spread of seasonal street dust, but current coronavirus restrictions may be providing some relief from this annual predicament, according to Pia Anttila, a researcher at the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI).
""Our experience, after one year of the pandemic, is that as traffic volumes have decreased, so have emissions, and air quality has improved. If the Covid-19 situation takes a turn for the worse, an improvement in air quality can be expected again,"" Anttila says.
Air pollution dropped dramatically in spring 2020
Traffic has a significant impact on urban air quality. Cars spread street dust from the surface of the road as well as release nitrogen dioxide into the air. A year ago, the coronavirus pandemic gave rise to urgent restrictions and many people started working from home in an effort to reduce social contacts.
This swift change in behavioural patterns was seen in pollution statistics, with car-related nitrogen dioxide emissions dropping drastically.
The amount of nitrogen dioxide in the air is indicative of how much people drive. Therefore, emissions can also be considered an indication of the efficacy of restrictions. Authorities recently used nitrogen dioxide values as a measure of human mobility, the same way mobile phone location data has been used previously.
The biggest change in pollution, in relation to last year, was in the Helsinki metropolitan area where the Uusimaa border closure cordoned off the area from the rest of the country for three weeks. Air pollution could decrease again this spring if new coronavirus measures restrict movement after the Easter holidays.
According to Anttila, the levels of nitric oxide started to increase again in the summer but have now stabilised at about 20 percent lower than normal.
Long-term environmental benefits?
Could the pandemic have long-term benefits for air quality? Possibly, if working from home becomes the new normal, Anttila says. The nitric oxide levels will however return to normal as soon as we resume regular traffic patterns.
In China, air pollution rose above pre-coronavirus levels in the summer as industry revved back up. Researchers estimate that the same can happen in Europe.
In Finland, the amount of nitrogen dioxide in urban air has been declining for years, in part because of more fuel-efficient cars.
At the same time, awareness of the health effects of air pollution has increased.
Will face masks remain a staple after the pandemic?
The widespread use of masks, such as the FFP2 mask, which protects against particles like street dust, could also bring relief to those suffering from pollen allergies, Anttila adds.
During the pandemic, the use of masks has become more widespread, and they may continue to be beneficial for high-risk groups by bringing much-needed relief during the street dust season.
Anttila says that although air quality routinely deteriorates in spring, Finland still remains a top contender for the cleanest air in Europe.
The FMI monitors air pollution in real time on its website, in order to inform citizens about air pollution exceeding threshold values."

Kautto's conduct had led to concern for his health, with tabloid Ilta-Sanomat reporting (external link in Finnish) that the deputy chair had to take over the meeting due to Kautto's erratic behaviour.
""Now that I have had some quiet time over Easter to think about this, I have come to the conclusion that the responsible thing to do is to resign from my position as chair. I will now focus on my role as a Member of Parliament,"" Kautto said in a press release.
The council meeting had to be adjourned due to Kautto's slurred speech and inability to perform his duties. He had consumed alcohol during the meeting and consequently became intoxicated.
""I am very sorry and I apologise for my actions. My conduct is wrong towards the other council members and the constituents. It is an embarrassing situation, but what is done is done,"" he said.
Kautto further stated that the incident made him realise that he needs help, and he has already sought assistance through occupational health.
""Some issues have built up while working remotely, and I medicated them with alcohol. Perhaps this unfortunate incident was needed for me to admit the severity of the situation,” Kautto wrote.
Chair of the Äänekoski Left Alliance's council group Matti Virtanen said he found Kautto's decision to resign surprising, but understandable.
""I understand that he wants to take responsibility for his actions. I did not expect this, but this is life. We are faced with a new situation and we need to move on. I hope Juho recovers. He retains the confidence of our group and myself. We want to be supportive,"" Virtanen said, adding that the party's council group intends to discuss the case in the upcoming days.

The idea of the bus is to push up testing numbers at locations like construction sites and among immigrant communities which have seen disproportionately high case numbers, HBL writes.
The bus will provide antigen tests free of charge. Any positive cases will be tested again with a more reliable PCR test to confirm the result.
""The bus will largely be driven to schools or workplaces where it is possible to test large groups. Alternatively, it could be driven to a place with lots of people, where passersby can go in and get tested,"" Lehtonen told the paper.
Kemijärvi variant still a mystery

Agency report identifies problems
The Finnish Education Evaluation Centre (FINEEC), an independent government agency that oversees the quality of education in Finland, identified problems in the vocational training of immigrants in a report (external link) entitled 'Immigrants’ educational pathways', which was published late last year.
The report found that while students with weaker language skills are accepted into vocational education, for some, the language skills they develop during their studies are not good enough for working life.
Categorised language proficiency requirements were abandoned in 2018, when the vocational education sector was reformed, but educational institutions still carry the responsibility of ensuring students starting studies have adequate language proficiency.
This does not seem to have happened across the board, the report found.
Story continues after the photo.

""Poor language skills make it difficult to progress in and complete studies,"" FINEEC's assessment specialist Raisa Hievanen tells Yle. ""In addition, there should be a place to help young people to develop their language skills if they are not at a sufficient level to complete their vocational studies.""
FINEEC therefore recommends that the Ministry of Education and Culture monitor the performance of immigrants in vocational education, especially in light of the relaxing of language skills requirements. Up to 10,000 young people drop out of vocational studies every year, with language skills often a contributing factor.
""Students who do not achieve strong basic knowledge and skills during the training will be in a vulnerable position in the …. world of work. Immigrants must also have the opportunity to engage in continuous learning and to progress in their career,"" the report stated.
Training for teachers also needed
In addition, some teachers in vocational schools feel that their skills are not sufficient to teach pupils with an immigrant background.
For example, 66 different mother tongues were spoken among students in the field of logistics between 2018 and 2020. In the social and health sector, the corresponding figure was 96.
FINEEC further recommends in-service training for teachers in so-called 'language-aware teaching' to tackle this problem.
Azad's parents came to Finland as refugees when he was less than a year old. He has grown up in a Swedish-speaking environment and studied in a Finnish-language primary school.
""Maybe that lack of language skills doesn't hurt in a big factory, but I couldn't imagine putting an employee on site who doesn't have a common language with a renovation customer. The Finnish language is certainly not the easiest to learn,"" he adds.
A total of 73 Vocational Education Training (VET) providers and 711 VET teachers responded to the FINEEC survey."

Seven new cases emerged over Easter, bringing the total number detected in the infection cluster to 49. All but five of the cases were detected in conscripts at the Reserve Officers School, with the remainder in other Army Academy students.
Ville Ronkainen, chief physician of the Hamina garrison, said the first of the recent cases began to have symptoms on 22 March, when he was tested for the virus.
""The first coronavirus infection here in Hamina came to light on 24 March. The second came to light the following day. The virus circulating in the garrison seems to be highly contagious,"" Ronkainen said.
Military's handling in the spotlight
According to Ronkainen, the highly-infectious British variant of the coronavirus is suspected of being behind the outbreak, although that will not be confirmed for at least a few weeks. Garrison officials are unable to say exactly how many chains of infection are currently in the garrison.
Director of the Reserve Officers School Colonel Vesa Helminen said there were many factors behind the surge in infections.
""The various infection chains probably developed independently and came to the garrison. All possible ways this could have happened are under investigation, along with the situation of rising numbers itself,"" he said.
A fateful forest camp
But one conscript serving in Hamina says he was involved in a forest training camp that was likely the source of the Reserve Officers School outbreak. He spoke to Yle on condition of anonymity, given the sensitivity of the situation.
He told Yle that one person left the training camp in the middle of the exercise. On the final morning, the rest of the participants were told the person had been diagnosed with coronavirus. The conscripts who were taking part in the forest training camp were then transferred to a building, separate from other members of the garrison.
According to the conscript Yle spoke to, isolation measures were not well implemented.

""The separation fell apart in the new place. The people who'd been in close contact with the infected person were spread around. Almost every dorm had someone who'd been in close contact with the infection. It was a real Covid-spinner, when they spread those people around,"" he said.
Chief physician Ronkainen said standard procedure was to isolate corona-positive, exposed asymptomatic and exposed symptomatic patients in separate locations. According to Ronkainen, the people exposed to the virus were divided into the smallest possible groups to limit the amount of time the virus could circulate among them.
""Priority must be given to preventing such exposures from occurring. It must be confirmed that all Defence Forces training and guidance has been followed here,"" Ronkainen said.
The consccript Yle spoke to said asymptomatic cases and those with mild symptoms were kept together, with isolation reserved for those with more severe symptoms.
""We were told that only those with severe symptoms could leave. It was an interesting approach, since normally those exposed to the coronavirus would be isolated even if they didn't show symptoms. It's now become easier to go into isolation, but at first it was only for severe symptoms,"" he told Yle.
Symptoms should be reported
Ronkainen did not deny that asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients were kept in the same dorms, although he said that efforts had been made to address this.
""Yes, the aim has been to separate the symptomatic from the asymptomatic cases, whether they were exposed or not,"" he said.

According to Ronkainen, conscripts who report coronavirus symptoms are provided with an isolation room and a test. The conscript must wait for the test results in isolation, he said.
""Of course, it requires a conscript to report symptoms and not just stay sick in the dorm,"" Ronkainen said.
The conscript Yle interviewed said he has been suffering mild coronavirus symptoms. He took a test a week ago on Monday and again this Tuesday.
""The latest test came up with nothing. It's a bad thing to leave a week between tests, quite a lot happened in between. Not that it matters much when the disease is already raging. The procedures should have worked better from the start.""
Reserve Officers School director Helminen said the outbreak was being investigated.
""Our goal is always to preserve people's health as much as possible. Analysis of the factors that led to an increase in cases is being carried out and will contribute to improving our processes in future,"" he said.
Pori brigade reported similar concerns
The Conscripts' Association told Yle that they had been contacted by conscripts in the Pori brigade, scene of a similar outbreak a few weeks ago. The Pori brigade saw more than 30 infections and over 300 service members placed in quarantine.
The association's president, Atte Grönroos, said that some members in Pori had reported that conscripts exposed to the virus had remained in close proximity to others.
""In very rare cases exposed and non-exposed people ate meals together, isolation measures were not sufficient. They were using the same sanitation facilities, and the adequacy of those facilities has of course been a problem,"" he said.
However, Grönroos stressed that the Defence Forces had made efforts to contain the spread of the virus among soldiers.
""They have taken radical steps. It is in the Defence Forces' favour that trainees remain healthy and no one is put in any danger,"" he said.
Grönroos also called for conscripts to be placed higher in the order of coronavirus vaccinations, after at-risk groups, healthcare workers and other priority groups have been vaccinated."

The count aims to provide an estimate of how many ringed seal pups were born over the winter.
More than 100 people, many of whom are volunteers from the Saimaa region, will take part in the process, which lasts for a few weeks.
There are thought to be around 420 Saimaa ringed seals in total living in lake Saimaa in eastern Finland. The endangered species relies on thick snow cover to build nests to protect its pups, which tend to be born in February.
Experts at national forestry and wildlife agency Metsähallitus estimate that snowy conditions this winter mean that the seal population could grow by up to 20 individuals.
Last winter, mild conditions saw the weakest snow and ice conditions in Saimaa in over 40 years. Volunteers shovelled snow to produce man-made drifts for the seals to nest in, but at least nine pups are known to have died.
Saimaa seals are regularly killed by drowning after becoming tangled in fishing nets in the lake.
Earlier this month, conservationists hit out at a fishing ban on the lake which they believe does not go far enough to protect the species.
""We build snowbanks [for nesting] and will in future make artificial dens to the extent that we can. But it's a waste of society's resources that each summer young seals die in amateur fishers' nets after they have been nurtured in artificial snowbanks all spring,"" said University of Eastern Finland Research Fellow Mervi Kunnasranta, who leads a seal research team.

According to a fresh report by the Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), the consumption drop was mainly due to a decrease in passenger imports from abroad — a result of coronavirus-related travel restrictions.
Passenger imports were halved last year compared to 2019. When unable to travel abroad for cheaper alcohol — mainly to Tallinn, Estonia — consumers increasingly ordered their beverages on the internet. The amount imported was an estimated 1.9 million liters of 100 percent alcohol, or nearly double that of the amount bought in 2019.
However, that amount only accounted for less than five percent of the country's overall alcohol consumption last year, according to THL.

Wine and spirits monopoly Alko as well as grocery stores benefited from the decrease in Baltic ferry imports. Last year, Alko's sales volumes rose by as much as 12 percent from 2019, while other retailersrecorded a four percent increase.
Retailgrowth was also boosted by restaurant restrictions imposed due to the Covid-19 situation. Due to restrictions, restaurant booze sales were effectively shut down for a couple of months last spring and limited in the fall.
Alcohol sales in pubs, bars and restaurants fell by 41 percent last year from the previous year, accounting for seven percent of the total consumption of alcohol last year.
Beer remains most popular
Last year the equivalent of 9.2 liters of 100 percent alcohol was consumed by every resident in Finland over the age of 15 years of age, a figure that has been declining for years.
Finns mainly consume their alcohol in the form of beer. The number has slowly been decreasing, but was still 46 percent last year. The most sought-after beer is still middle-strength (up to 4.7%), although stronger beers have grown in popularity since alcohol reform law rolled out in 2018, which raised the limits on alcoholic drinks sold in supermarkets and other shops from 4.7 percent to 5.5 percent.
Meanwhile, the popularity of low-alcohol wines (5.5% and below) increased somewhat while the consumption of spirits declined. Those beverages each accounted for 21 percent of alcohol consumed last year.
Biggest sales bump in Åland
Alcohol sales increased in 2020 in all regions except Lapland, Uusimaa and Pirkanmaa.
Sales increased the most in Åland, growing by 24.3 percent, South Savo (5.4%), Kymenlaakso (5.0%) and North Karelia (5.0%). The growth in Åland, which is an island in the Archipelago, was attributed to the impact of coronavirus travel restrictions.
Alcohol sales decreased in Lapland, going down by 5.6 percent, Uusimaa (2.3%) and Pirkanmaa (0.1%) compared to 2019.
Most alcohol sold, per capita, was in Lapland, but much of the northern region's alcohol trade can be attributed to large numbers of tourists.
The least amount of alcohol sold, per capita, was in Ostrobothnia."

The report also highlighted growing inequality and the treatment of transgender people and conscientious objectors as areas of concern.
The 2020 Amnesty report focused on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on human rights around the world, saying it has ""highlighted structural inequalities, particularly those affecting women, ethnic minorities, refugees, the elderly and health professionals.""
""The world before us is in disarray. With the pandemic at this stage, even the most deluded leaders have difficulty denying the fact that our social, economic and political systems are broken,"" Amnesty Secretary General Agnès Callamard said.
Refugee rights lacking
The report reserved its harshest criticism for Finland's treatment of refugees, listing the detention of families with children, restriction of access to free legal representation and reduced time frames for appeals as particularly pressing issues.
""Family reunification of those who have received international protection from Finland is still very difficult and the rights of the child are not sufficiently taken into account in the processes,"" Amnesty said.
The NGO report also cites a case of a man who was reportedly killed after being deported to Iraq in 2017, although police investigators later found that the man was still alive. His daughter and her former husband received prison sentences in February for misleading authorities and the courts.
Gender-based violence
While the Amnesty report highlighted that domestic violence against women had grown worldwide during the pandemic, Finland received specific criticism for what Amnesty called a lack of long-term support for victims of sexual violence.
Finland's rape legislation was also highlighted as a problem, echoing a citizens' initiative that sparked moves to redefine rape in legal terms last year.
""In Finland, too, coronavirus has made structural inequality visible. During and after a pandemic, it is particularly important to invest in safeguarding human rights and dismantling unequal structures. The human rights impact of every political decision must be assessed at the municipal level, in legislation and in the state budget,"" Niina Laajapuro, Director of Human Rights at Amnesty International Finland said."

The government met Wednesday night to discuss a plan to lift restrictions. The discussion is scheduled to continue on Thursday with the political opposition.
According to Marin, the restrictions are to be lifted in reverse order. The first step will be to lift the state of emergency and end the use of the Emergency Powers Act. Nationwide restrictions on restaurants may be lifted on 18 April.
A key principle is that restrictions on activities by children and young people are to be lifted before those on adults.
According to Marin, a large-scale opening of public events may be possible in June or early July.
However, Turun Sanomat notes that Marin added that it is not yet possible to give any exact date for a return to normal.
One reason is that restrictions on schools, hobbies and gatherings in public spaces are largely in the hands of municipalities and regional authorities.
According to a draft seen by Helsingin Sanomat on Wednesday, the lifting of restrictions would begin this month and proceed gradually up until August. Schools would return to contact teaching in May, and libraries and museums, for example, could reopen their doors at the same time.
Restrictions on gatherings would be lifted between June and August. The aim would be to assess the conditions for lifting the restrictions every two weeks.
The tabloid Iltalehti reports that the government will continue working on the plan on Thursday, and discuss it with all the parties represented in Parliament.
Prime Minister Marin tweeted late Wednesday that the plan will be presented Friday for a one-week round of feedback, and separate talks will be held with labour market organisations and the municipal sector.
Summer travel
The daily Helsingin Sanomat looks at plans by cruise operators and Finnair to provide summer travel opportunities as restrictions are eased.
Shipping lines, it writes, are making preparations to again increase the number of vessels in service and the number of departures, but much depends on the situation and the pace of vaccination in Finland, Estonia and Sweden.
""Vaccinations and testing play a key role. If all goes well, passenger traffic will gradually recover as early as summer. Local tourism is likely to be the first to return,"" Tiina Tuurnala, CEO of the Finnish Shipowners' Association, told Helsingin Sanomat.
A key reason that cruise travel may recover is that ships have plenty of room for passengers to maintain safe distancing.
In March last year, the cruise ship industry halted most passenger traffic due to coronavirus restrictions imposed by the authorities. Recreational travel recovered somewhat last summer, but travel restrictions were re-imposed in August.
Of Viking Line's seven vessels, four are currently in service. Viking Line plans to open special cruises to Gotland, Åland and Riga, among other possible destinations.
Tallink Silja intends to make decisions in April on reintroducing its vessel the Europa on the Helsinki-Tallinn route and on restarting services on its Helsinki-Turku and Helsinki-Riga routes.
Finnair, for its part, says that its exit plan will closely follow the national strategy.
""The return of travel depends very much on the development of vaccine coverage and how different countries, including Finland, start to lift travel restrictions,"" according to Päivyt Tallqvist, Finnair's Director of Communications.
Finnair has continued international flights throughout the pandemic, but only to about half of its normal 100 destinations. The number of flights has also dropped from about 350 daily flights to 75. Many routes have been flown on smaller aircraft than normal, and passenger volume is about 10 percent of pre-pandemic numbers.
Transgender law update
A citizens' initiative calling for revisions to Finland's transgender law has gained 50,000 signatures and will now proceed to parliament, reports Tampere's Aamulehti.
Entitled ""The Right to Be Initiative"", the call to change provisions of the law was launched on Tuesday and collected all the needed signatures by late Wednesday.
Among the changes that initiative sets out is the removal of the requirements for transgender people to be medically diagnosed and to be sterilized as conditions for official recognition of gender change.
If approved, official change of gender would in future be a matter of filing a notice for anyone over the age of 15. In the case of younger people, the consent of a guardian would be required.
Also, the so-called ""transgender register"", that is the list of persons who have legally changed their gender, would be removed from the population register.
Finland's current transgender legislation, which dates from 2003, has received both domestic and international criticism as being in violation of human rights agreements.
Posti loses client
Ilta-Sanomat reports that Finland's National Archives has announced it is terminating cooperation with the Finnish postal service Posti, after an incident in which the company said it had lost a shipment of archive materials.
The case concerned documents requested by an amateur historian in Helsinki from the Jyväskylä office of the National Archives.
They were handed over to Posti for delivery in January, but the consignment did not arrive in Helsinki. Following a complaint, an initial search by Posti for the shipment came up empty-handed.
This week, the National Archives announced that it would terminate Posti services for inter-library loans, writing on its website that, ""due to serious disturbances and the disappearance of materials, the National Archives will no longer use Posti's services to transport documentary cultural property under its responsibility"".
A few hours later, Posti announced that the shipment had been found.
National Archive Director Päivi Hirvonen told the paper that even though the materials were recovered, it does not change the body's intention to seek tenders from courier services for the transport of its materials."

Some 160 workers from Ukraine were tested for the coronavirus less than 72 hours before their departure to Finland, then re-tested at Helsinki Airport on arrival.
On Tamsaari farm in Merimasku, Naantali, where four workers from the first flight are already settling into their routines, another Covid test was issued a few days later, explains owner Stiina Lerkki.
""Between the testing at the airport and on location, the employees are isolated from each other, in their own separate spaces,"" she adds.
While safety is a priority for employers, there is no denying the prejudice facing seasonal workers coming from abroad.
""We all have prejudices towards this disease, but it is something we now have to live with. We handle the situation with these workers the same way we handle our other employees, responsibly and safely,"" says Lerkki.
Need for international workers increases in summer
Recruitment service Töitä Suomesta transports workers to Finland on charter planes from. The company regularly flies in seasonal workers from Ukraine.
""There is currently a demand for seasonal workers in southwestern Finland, where harvesting has already begun. The demand then moves to other parts of the country and is at its peak during the berry picking season in Suonenjoki and Savo,"" says Marko Mäki-Hakola, Director of Business Development at the Central Union of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners of Finland (MTK), who also works for Töitä Suomesta.
Charter planes also arrived last year, in the midst of the pandemic. Mäki-Hakola says the Finnish government for encouraged this corona-safe arrangement. He estimates that 10,000 to 16,000 seasonal workers will be needed during the summer season.
""Last year, 3,000 seasonal workers arrived on our flights, and there were no cases of Covid-19 present. The tests and quarantines are implemented carefully,"" says Mäki-Hakola."

One question high on the list is whether public events, such as festivals can be organised and held, even on a reduced scale.
Even before the government has finalised an exit strategy, the events industry has been working on its own plan for summer activities which relies on the use of rapid coronavirus testing.
The concept is simple. Members of the public would be allowed into events after providing a negative result to an on-site test.
The practicality of such a system is to be evaluated with pilot events designed by event organisers in cooperation with researchers and testing professionals.
Maria Sahlstedt, Director of Communications & Public Affairs at Event Industries of Finland, was unable to tell Yle when these pilots may be launched, however, as permission is still needed from various authorities.
The introduction of rapid tests at events is not without some snags, though. Currently, coronavirus testing can only be performed by healthcare professionals and testing resources in general are insufficient to allowing testing to be expanded to any major degree.
Story continues after the photo.

Rapid testing would likely work best for smaller events.
""Tens of thousands of people come to stadium-class concerts, so on-site testing would not be an option,"" Sahlstedt points out.
According to Sahlstedt, the aim of the pilot events is to study more than just how coronavirus testing could be used. There has been research carried out in Finland on how the virus spreads in restaurant settings, and the same, she says, should be done for public events.
""This would provide preparation not only for next summer, but also for the future. We are trying to study event security under emergency conditions and how we can better prepare for the risks. If the pandemic strikes again, we will have ready-made solutions so that the event sector no longer needs to be so completely closed down,"" Sahlstedt explains.
Coronavirus passport one option
She believes that the most effective solution for the safe organisation of events would be an officially approved coronavirus passport. One is to be introduced in Denmark at the end of May, and a passport there will be issued if a person has contracted and recovered from the disease, or has been vaccinated. Following a negative test, the passport is valid for three days.
""A coronavirus passport would serve a wide range of sectors in addition to events, such as tourism, restaurants and transport,"" notes Sahlstedt.
The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare THL has declined to comment at this stage on the prospect of introducing a coronavirus passport as the government's exit plan has not yet been finalized.
The Finnish government's decision on opening the events sector has lagged behind Denmark, for example. The events industry sees this as a threat.
""Finnish event audiences may travel to neighbouring countries next summer if large events can be held there safely. At the same time, it will become more difficult to attract international performers and events to Finland,"" says Sahlstedt.
A working group convened by Minister of Science and Culture Annika Saarikko (Cen) has, however, already drafted a plan on how public events could be safely organised in Finland. It is included in the exit strategy currently being considered by the government."

The court sentenced the main perpetrators of the so-called Katiska drug ring, Niko Ranta-aho and Janne Tranberg, to more than 10 years in prison for aggravated drug offenses and other charges.
The case was one of biggest drug investigations in Finnish history, involving the Cannonball and Hells Angels motorcycle gangs and an array of celebrities.
Tranberg was sentenced to 12 years and 11 months in prison, while Ranta-aho was handed an 11-year term. Seven other men were sentenced to 8-10 years in prison.
The prosecutor had demanded 13-year sentences for the two main defendants, the longest possible imprisonment for felony drug offences in Finland.

However, the court mitigated Ranta-aho's verdict as he had confessed to being guilty and helped police to find several drug caches.
Tranberg's verdict, in turn, was affected by his previous imprisonment. Tranberg, the former leader of the Cannonball motorcycle gang who was arrested in Spain in late 2019, is already serving a nearly three-year term for tax fraud and money laundering.

The capital loan now granted will go towards starting commercial-scale production of protein for human consumption made from atmospheric carbon dioxide and electricity.
According to Solar Foods CEO Pasi Vainikka, the company's aim is break the direct link between food production and agriculture.
""Our gift to society, the essence of what we are doing, is to decouple food production from agriculture. After that, all the climate benefits basically fall into your lap when this disconnection can be accomplished,"" says Vainikka.
The company says that changing the way protein is produced will have an effect not only on greenhouse gases, but also on the changes in land use, soil impoverishment, biodiversity, and the status of water systems.
Traditional food production is one of the largest burdens on ecosystems in Finland and globally, while deforestation caused by food production in developing countries, for example, worsens the climate crisis.
Exceptional project
The Finnish Climate Fund describes the planned Solar Foods facility as the first commercially operating plant in the world to produce protein from carbon dioxide and electricity. The new plant is scheduled to be operational in early 2023.
In remarks to the media at the announce of the loan arrangements, Finnish Climate Fund chair Perttu Puro pointed out the special nature of this first investment decision.
""With regard to Solar Foods, it is also good to note that it is well understood, or at least I think so, that this is a very exceptional project,"" he said.
In practice, funding can be provided for more tried and tested technologies.

The survey examined people's attitudes towards restrictions and their effectiveness in tackling the virus as well as attitudes towards policymakers, and found that Finnish respondents had the most trust in their government and medical care.
""Maybe this has been the reason for the successful Finnish coronavirus strategy, and for having the lowest rate of cumulative cases of Covid-19, 1009.5, and cumulative deaths, 13.3 (per 100,000 population) (2 March 2021), in comparison with the rest of the European countries involved in our study,"" the survey concluded.
Compliance with safety distance measures and the recommendation for telecommuting were perceived in Finland as less restrictive than in the ten other countries surveyed.
""Finns' confidence in policymakers came to the fore in our survey. However, clear communication on the selection criteria for restrictions and their effectiveness is important,"" University of Turku postdoctoral researcher Tella Lantta wrote in the university's press release announcing the results of the survey.
Lantta led the research in Finland.
In addition to Finland, the study was conducted in the Netherlands, Belgium, Bulgaria, India, the United Kingdom, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Sweden and the Czech Republic.
The survey was answered by 9,543 people, which included 542 people living in Finland. Respondents assessed the effectiveness, impact on life, and compliance with 44 different coronavirus containment measures.
Fear of infection, gender, and age influence perception of restrictions
The survey found that people's tendency to comply with restrictions was clearly associated with a fear of becoming infected. However, non-compliance with restrictions was linked to beliefs that the response of the state leadership to prevent the spread of the pandemic was perceived as too extreme.
""Citizens are prepared to comply with coronavirus restrictions that restrict their own fundamental rights if they are perceived to be effective. However, more important than the perceived effectiveness of using a mask, for example, is that citizens trust the policymakers,"" Lantta said.
The study also found that level of education, gender, and age influenced people's perception of the restrictions. Higher education, older age, and female gender increased the likelihood of complying with restrictions."

In the last municipal election in 2017 turnout varied widely by ethnic group. Among native speakers of Estonian, turnout was 11.1 percent, while some 53 percent of Somali-speakers voted.
Among Finnish speakers the figure was 58.9 percent and some 70 percent of Swedish-speakers voted.
There are fewer candidates and voters from minority backgrounds, and that affects decision-making.
Researcher Josefina Sipinen told us that people from foreign backgrounds do want to get involved as candidates — they just need a bit of encouragement.
""Many people could be willing to join if asked, that's very clear in my study,"" said Sipinen. ""[It's clear] that migrants more often than natives lack this encouragement that they need.""
""Only voters' voices are heard""
Language can be an obstacle for some, but Sipinen found clear indications of what it would take for parties to recruit a more diverse range of candidates.
""Even if one speaks fluent Finnish, one might think that okay, maybe I don't have the experience that's needed,"" said Sipinen. ""I haven't lived here that long, am I welcome, how do native voters welcome me as a candidate, what kind of public attention do I get, is it more negative than positive. So migrant candidates need more push and pull from parties, and from their own networks.""
That said, there's a clear benefit to getting involved. Sipinen said that diverse decision-making improves the decisions themselves, as well as making certain groups' voices heard — but self-interest is the key motivating factor for anyone to vote.
""So we know that migrant voters have certain issues that are important to them, and they aren't heard in decision-making unless they are there,"" said Sipinen. ""Only voters' voices are heard in decision-making. If one doesn't participate, then parties aren't really interested in you and your group.""
Sipinen's thesis, Recruitment of Immigrant-origin Candidates in Finnish Municipal Elections, will be defended on 24 April.

At the time, police estimated that about 300 protesters were in attendance.
The organisers of the protest did not follow the plan agreed with police in advance, a police statement said. Protesters also ignored police orders that participants should gather in groups of no more than six, instead of as a unified group.
""Some of the 46 suspects have been fined for a breach of the gathering restriction, while there was found to be no reason to suspect a crime for a number of others,"" Inspector Juha-Matti Suominen wrote in the press release. ""Some of the cases will proceed through preliminary investigation to prosecution because no consent has been obtained for the fine proceedings or because the suspicion of a crime has been disputed.""
Freedom of expression and assembly are fundamental rights that are protected by the police. However, officers may intervene during the course of a demonstration if it is deemed to endanger public order and safety, obstructs traffic or is contrary to decisions made under section 58 of the Communicable Diseases Act, such as the restriction on group sizes.
Criticism for allowing protest 
Helsinki police received criticism for allowing the protest to go ahead, especially as the Uusimaa region had the highest rate of coronavirus infections in Finland at the time of the demonstration.
The Regional State Administrative Agency of Southern Finland (Avi) had banned public events for more than six people, a ban which was to be monitored by the police.
Many of the protestors did not wear masks and did not observe safety distances. A small number of participants also tried to provoke the police officers on duty at the protest, police added.
Organisers and the police had agreed before the protest that Helsinki's Citizens’ Square could accommodate a maximum of 15 separate demonstrations, each with a maximum of six participants. As more people arrived, the separate groups formed a much bigger group.
In the end, police allowed all of the protestors to stay and the demonstration continued on the condition that the hundreds of protesters gathered in groups of up to six people. Some participants tried to follow police instructions, some did not.
""However, the organiser managed to decentralise the group a bit, so it was decided that it was more sensible to let the demonstration continue to the end. Next time, we will try to be better prepared,"" Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinonen told Yle after the demonstration."

Furthermore, Yli-Viikari has been embroiled in an expenses scandal since reports emerged that she spent about 5,000 euros of public money on hairdressing and beauty services. There were also questions over her use of Finnair Bonus flight points.
The commission said that Yli-Viikari's ability to perform her duties while the preliminary investigation is ongoing has substantially deteriorated.
The VTV is responsible for auditing government agencies. Green Party MP and chair of Parliament's Audit Committee Outi Alanko-Kahiluoto previously stated that the scandal was affecting the agency's staff and reputation.
Announcing the decision on Thursday afternoon, Speaker of Parliament Anu Vehviläinen (Cen) noted that Yli-Viikari failed to provide satisfactory answers at two committee meetings last month.
""At today's meeting, her answers did not satisfy us as members of the Chancellery Commission either,"" Vehviläinen said, adding that the use of public money is dependent upon the trust of citizens.
""Public debate has played a role in the formation of the overall picture,"" she said.
The possible permanent dismissal of Yli-Viikari from her role would need to be decided by a plenary session of Parliament."

Due to coronavirus restrictions on travel and bars, Alko's position as an alcohol vendor was significantly improved, which was reflected in its revenues.
Net sales improved to 1.3 billion euros from 1.1 billion euros in the previous year, with a significant improvement in operating profit. It climbed from around 40 million euros in 2019 to nearly 65 million euros last year.
""In line with our mission, we do not seek to sell as much alcohol as possible or maximise our financial results. However, cost-effective operations are important,"" CEO Leena Laitinen said on Thursday.
Last year's profit significantly exceeded the operating profit for 2017, the last year before an alcohol reform came into force at the beginning of 2018. The reform took away Alko's exclusive right to sell some products, resulting in a drastic drop in sale volumes.
Last year's rise in earnings will also boost dividends paid by the company to its owner, the state. While the annual dividend has stood still at 30 million euros in recent years, the company's board plans to increase the dividend to 60 million euros this year, the highest ever paid into state coffers.
Alko's beverage sales rose to nearly 93 million litres last year, compared to 82 million the previous year.
Boom in rosé wine sales 
According to the company, sales were up in nearly all product groups. The biggest increase in litre sales was in rosé wines(up by 40 percent), followed by white and red wines (up 15-17 percent). Sales of pre-mixed drinks, beers and ciders, which fell as a result of the alcohol reform, rose into positive territory. Only sales of liqueurs and other lower-alcohol spirits decreased in 2020.
Despite the strong growth, litre sales were still somewhat behind the 2017 peak. However higher net sales and profits indicate that the company is selling pricier – and more profitable – products than before.
Alko was long the leading place to buy alcohol, but it lost its status to grocery stores in 2008, and since then the gap has gradually widened. Alko's market share is now 37 percent, compared to 45 percent for other stores. Personal imports, for instance from ferry trips to Estonia or Sweden, have also accounted for a large share, but that nearly evaporated last year due to Covid restrictions.
A day earlier, the Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) reported that alcohol consumption in Finland fell by five percent in 2020 year-on-year, the steepest statistical decline since 2012. This was mainly due to a decrease in passenger imports from abroad, it said."

According to Kiuru, the Finnish government has been excited about the Covid passport system planned in Denmark, among other places. She described the certificate as possibly being a QR code that would be received by mobile phone that would be easy to display, if needed.
Iltalehti pointed out that while various terms have been used in public debate on the issue, Kiuru consistently used the phrase ""rokotetodistus"", that is ""vaccination certificate"".
The paper goes on to write that Prime Minister Sanna Marin (SDP) said on Thursday that introducing a ""vaccination passport"" would not necessarily make sense in light of the timetable of the government's exit strategy.
""We assume that if sufficient deliveries of vaccine materialize, we will be able to vaccinate the entire adult population during the summer. From this point of view, creating a passport is not relevant. We also do not have legislation to ban those who have not been vaccinated from using services,"" said Marin.
More economic focus
The business and economic daily Kauppalehti reports that employers' groups say the government's exit strategy gives too little attention to reviving the national economy, describing it as an important first step, but no more.
Mika Kuismanen, who is Chief Economist at the Federation of Finnish Enterprises, pointed out to the paper that a significant number of companies will continue to face major financial problems for at least a year.
""Many restrictions will remain in place for a long time. Uncertainty affects consumption, and for example, events cannot be organized normally in the early summer. We still need a lot of different individual flexibility mechanisms, through which companies can, for example, spread out statutory payments over a longer period of time,"" said Kuismanen.
Jyri Häkämies, CEO of the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK), has previously stated that the subsidies provided by Finland to companies have been moderate in overall European comparisons.
Häkämies has stressed that a fourth government support package for companies must move ahead. Kuismanen agreed.
""Cost support package number four will definitely be coming. The need for aid is still great. I'm afraid this this is being overlooked in the excitement of the exit, ” Kuismanen told Kauppalehti.
Secretive emails
Jyväskylä's Keskisuomalainen carries a report by the Uutissuomalainen news group stating that the Prime Minister's Office has refused to make public email correspondence concerning a social media analysis published by Nato's Strategic Communications (StratCom) Centre of Excellence.
That report, published in March, said that the Finnish coalition government has been the subject of a constant campaign of hate speech on social media. It stated that the five ministers most affected are women and are the target of a massive, hostile attack that calls into question their values, decision-making and leadership qualities.
The Uutissuomalainen news group requested email exchanges between the Prime Minister's Office and StratCom for the period of 1 January 2019 to 18 March 2021.
The request was filed in the wake of speculation that Prime Minister's Office was involved in the StratCom Centre's investigation.
Jussi Toivanen, Chief Communications Specialist at Finnish Prime Minister's Office, denied to Uutissuomalainen that the office had ""agreed on or placed an order for"" the study. He told Uutissuomalainen that communication was originally carried out with the centre’s steering group on ""another topic"".
According to Toivanen, emails in question are ""documents prepared for the internal work of the authorities” and “informal e-mail correspondence"", which do not need to be archived, and are not subject to the Act on the Openness of Government Activities.
Tomi Voutilainen, Professor of Pubic Law at the University of Eastern Finland, told Uutissuomalainen that it is not possible to assess the legality of keeping the correspondence classified without actually seeing the content of the emails. He added though, that technological developments have made Act on the Openness of Government Activities outdated and that it is currently being revised.
Rethinking summer tyres
Tampere's Aamulehti is among the papers warning readers that the spring-like weather of recent days is set to change on Friday, and roads may be slippery and hazardous as snow, sleet and rain is forecast for large parts of the country.
Hannu Valta of the Finnish Meteorological Institute told the paper that drivers who have already switched over to summer tyres should consider alternative means of transport. If it is absolutely necessary to use one's own car in areas with slippery roads, Valta suggested paying very close attention to safe distancing in traffic, or to change back to winter tyres.
Sunny spring-like days interspersed by snowstorms, he pointed out, are typical of the first half of April in Finland. Significantly warmer weather previously in the forecast for next week now looks unlikely, and temperatures will probably stay in the 5C to 10C range."

The plan would see primary school students in all parts of the country return to classrooms in April while bars and restaurants would be permitted to open their doors to customers once again.
There are still many uncertainties surrounding the plan to ease restrictions, as measures may need to be kept or reintroduced if the epidemic situation worsens, but the government presented the draft to the opposition parties on Thursday and intends to officially publish the finalised plan on Friday.
Here is a summary of the main points of the plan:
April, end of exceptional circumstances:
Use of Emergency Powers Act expiresPrimary school students return to classroomsBars and restaurants open, with limits on customer capacity
May, further lifting of restrictions
Restrictions aimed at curbing rapid acceleration of the epidemic will be removedOutdoor hobbies for children and young people beginGrades 7-9, high schools and vocational schools return to classrooms nationwidePublic spaces, such as libraries and museums, openWork-related travel within the EU will be permitted
June, phasing out of regional restrictions
Restrictions on public gatherings will be relaxedRestrictions on opening hours, capacity of bars and restaurants will be relaxedOutdoor group activities for adults beginAudience events begin, with limits on attendanceEU internal border controls end
July-August, increase vaccination coverage
Restrictions on gatherings will be relaxed and removedRestrictions on participation in public events will be relaxedGroup hobbies start againWork-related travel outside the EU opens up
Keep up to date on regional, national and international Covid data with Yle's dashboard.
Vaccination progress and lifting of restrictions go 'hand in hand'
The government will closely monitor vaccination coverage as restrictions are relaxed, with a current estimate that all elderly people will have received at least one dose of a vaccine by the end of April and people in at-risk groups by the end of May.
The government hopes that 50 percent of the working-age population will receive at least one dose by June, rising to 100 percent by August. The elderly and at-risk groups are projected to receive their second dose by August.
However, the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare's (THL's) projections are subject to change due to uncertainties over the supply of vaccines, their restrictions on different age groups and people's willingness to take the jab.
Epidemic likely to ease by May Day
The government's plan relies on the THL assessment that the coronavirus situation will begin to ease by around the end of April or the start of May. If this happens, there would be an opportunity for the gradual opening up of society ahead of the summer months.
The assessment is based on the assumption that the vaccination rollout will proceed as planned, which is described in the plan as ""cautious"".
Not all restrictions will be eased however, even by the end of the summer, as many people would still not be fully vaccinated and the more contagious variants of the virus would likely be the most infectious forms.

The easing of restrictions will depend on Finland's vaccination rollout.Jorge Gonzalez / Yle
The plan therefore predicts that the number of infections will begin to rise again in August as social contacts in schools and workplaces increase.
However, this increase in infections is expected to be more moderate than last autumn, as vaccination coverage for adults, especially younger adults, would be sufficiently high to prevent a surge in infections.
Plan dependent on several indicators
The government will not begin to automatically lift restrictions during the spring and summer, as the relaxing or removal of restrictions will depend on the epidemic situation at the time based on several indicators.
The first of these indicators is the infection rate, which would need to reduce to about 50 cases per 100,000 inhabitants over the previous two week period throughout the country. In addition, chains of infection should be under control and the proportion of positive results in all coronavirus tests should be less than 1.5 percent.
Each phasing-out of a restriction would be accompanied by a two- or three-week observation period, after which further restrictions could be lifted.
The government is also working to coordinate the lifting of restrictions with other EU countries, as member states have agreed that external borders can be opened when the epidemic situation in neighbouring countries are the same.
EU travel possible with 'Covid passport'
EU countries are preparing a common ""Covid passport"" that would allow for travel between member states for people who have been vaccinated, those who have a negative test result, or those who have previously had the virus.
Finland is preparing for the Finnish vaccine passport to be ready by the end of the summer. It will be implemented using the Omakanta system, which allows users to view their own health information, including records and prescriptions.
The EU Commission had previously hoped that the passport system would be in place by the end of June, but many countries have indicated that they will miss this deadline.
The government's plan states that ""due to the pace of vaccination, the government does not consider it appropriate to introduce privilege schemes for those who have been vaccinated,"" and therefore restrictions on travel would still apply to all people living in Finland.

The government also plans that work-related travel and trips to see close family within the European Union would be possible again in May or June.
Work-related travel to the EU from non-EU countries could possibly begin again in early autumn, while tourism travel to Finland from outside the EU is more vaguely described in the plan, ""as the epidemic fades"".
Bars, restaurants open under strict conditions
The current closure of bars and restaurants in most parts of Finland is due to end on Sunday 18 April. After that, the government plans that the re-opening of premises would be accompanied by restrictions on opening hours and limits on the number of customers allowed at any one time.
A bill is currently being considered by Parliament, which would make it possible to regulate the opening hours of bars and restaurants more strictly than before the closure order.
At its strictest, the bill would mean bars and restaurants in the worst-affected areas could be ordered to stop serving as early as 5pm and close their doors by 6pm.
If the virus situation improves, it is likely that the strictest regulations on bars and restaurants would apply to a smaller number of regions than the current closure order.
Events could restart in three stages
The government plans to facilitate the organisation of events, such as concerts and festivals, through a three stage process. However, these restrictions are decided independently by municipalities and regional state administrative agencies (Avi's).
In the first stage, it would be possible to organise events in which audience members are assigned their own places and groups could avoid close contact with each other.
At this stage, the national infection rate should be 75 cases per 100,000 inhabitants over the preceding two week period, and the regional situation should also be under control.

In the second stage, it would be possible to hold ""bigger events"", but the maximum audience should be scaled according to the space. In this situation, the national infection rate should not exceed 50.
In the third stage, restrictions would be lifted entirely.
Mask, telecommuting recommendations may end in June
As part of the lifting of restrictions, the government intends in early June to consider removing the recommendations to wear face masks and to work from home if possible.
However, both recommendations will be reconsidered again in August, as the end of summer holidays may lead to a spread of the virus among unvaccinated people.
In addition, recommendations to stay at home and go for a coronavirus test if coronavirus symptoms are evident may remain in place for a long time until the epidemic subsides.
Recommendations for good hand and cough hygiene may also remain on a permanent basis."

In a commercial pilot effort, the company that developed the device, Trombia Technologies, agreed with Espoo to test the sweeper in the city's Mankka neighborhood, in order to examine the vehicle's autonomous capabilities.
The device — the Trombia Free — looks a bit like an aerodynamic yacht, uses lidar technology and, according to the firm, uses 85 percent less energy than conventional, diesel-powered street sweepers.
""We are thrilled to start the pilot program with the City of Espoo. When we think about the over three million metric tons of carbon emissions that high power diesel-fueled suction street sweepers around the world produce annually, we see that smart cities around the world can act to reduce their energy consumption and carbon emissions significantly by modernising the way street cleaning is made,"" Trombia Technologies CEO Antti Nikkanen said in a statement.
The firm said that the Trombia Free is an all-weather machine and able to safely navigate in rainy or snowy conditions, due to the lidar tech built into the device.
The device was launched in September, and Trombia Technologies said it plans further pilot programmes in other locations later this spring."

Turtiainen has formed his own one-man parliamentary party since being expelled from the Finns Party's parliamentary group last year.
A large number of MPs from different parties met on Friday to discuss the issue, including the speakers of Parliament, the committee chairs, and the chairs of each parties' parliamentary group, where it was decided that Turtiainen would not be reprimanded for the tweet.
""It was our unanimous view,"" Speaker of Parliament Anu Vehviläinen (Cen) said after the meeting.
Although MPs are required to speak respectfully during parliamentary speeches, Parliament cannot interfere in other forms of communication, such as blog posts or Twitter posts.
""It is not for Parliament to intervene in the statements made elsewhere by a Member of Parliament,"" Vehviläinen stated, adding that this does not, however, remove personal responsibility from the communication.
""Speaking and writing are the most important tools for a Member of Parliament,"" she said.
Turtiainen's response calmed situation
Vehviläinen further said that the parliamentary groups also discussed the limits on freedom of speech within the communications environment of the 2020s.
""The unanimous message from the meeting was that we do not accept any kind of aggressive rhetoric or intimidation, or even overt or covert intimidation,"" Vehviläinen said.
Some politicians had interpreted Turtiainen's tweet as putting pressure on MPs in favour of introducing a compulsory order on the wearing of face masks.
On Tuesday, the speakers of Parliament group discussed Turtiainen's tweet and stated that it took the matter very seriously. Following that meeting, Turtiainen submitted a written response to a parliamentary request, in which he stated that there was no threat or danger to MPs in any way.
Vehviläinen added that she thanked Turtiainen for the reply.
""I welcome the fact that Turtiainen pointed out in his own defence that there is no threat to other representatives in any way. I met him a moment ago in the hallway and stated it to him,"" Vehviläinen said."

However, the report's authors noted, tough measures are still needed from countries to achieve goals of limiting global warming temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius (or a maximum of 2 degrees), per the Paris Agreement on climate change.
The report was written by a group of economist researchers from around the world who said that it would still be possible to achieve the goals of the international treaty — without stopping economic growth.
The researchers said they disagreed with the widely-held conception that the goals of economic growth and reducing emissions were at odds with each other.
Economy grew, emissions declined
The researchers further noted that as the EU's economy grew during the years 1990-2016 by more than 50 percent, the bloc also saw a 25 percent decline in carbon emissions.
According to the group, public policies were the foundation of achieving both goals.
""There are countries where economic growth has continued as emissions have decreased,"" economics Professor Paul Ekins from University College London told Yle.
However a leading expert at Sitra, Saara Tamminen, said just because it is possible to combine improved climate and economic goals, it does not mean that economic growth can continue the way it has to date.
She warned that continuing current economic practices could lead to serious ecological, economic and social consequences.

Economics Professor Paul Ekins from University College LondonUCL
Meanwhile, Professor Ekins said that achieving the 1.5-degree goal will be challenging but thinks it is still possible.
""It is very difficult to achieve what we still need to achieve. I think it is fairly unlikely that we will manage to keep it below 1.5 degrees,"" he said, pointing out that limiting global temperature rises to 1.6 degrees rather than 2 degrees would still be a significant achievement.
Meeting those goals will require ambitious and consistent policies across all economic sectors, but that political promises also need to become realities in the coming decades.
The report noted that in order to meet climate goals, all countries must stop using coal as an energy source, adding that new technologies need to be used to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as well.
Additionally, the researchers recommend that industry needs to transition to emission-free sources of energy in lieu of fossil fuels.
Ekins pointed out however that the biggest hurdles were with policy-makers as well as others, saying he was most concerned about the world's political systems and a general decline in the appreciation of science."

Disadvantages included the lack of social contact with colleagues and the constant presence of work-related matters at home.

The cost of remote schooling
As distance learning in the capital region is phased out from today, Helsingin Sanomat asks how the extended period of remote schooling has impacted young people.
The pandemic has not treated school students equally, the paper writes, highlighting that secondary school pupils in Kokkola and Kajaani have been able to attend class in person throughout the academic year, while those in the Helsinki metropolitan area and Turku have not.
Individuals have also responded differently to the unusual situation, HS writes. ""The gap between those who succeed and those who don't is now bigger. For those who have problems, those problems can be very complicated,"" vocational college nurse Tuulia Ahopelto told the paper.
But one Helsinki student, Anna, told HS that in spite of the considerable difficulties she had faced while distance learning, the alternative could be worse.
""Better to be at home distance learning than to be the reason someone got sent to intensive care or died,"" she said.

The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) says that while the risk of blood clots in those who have received the AZ vaccine is a real one, it's very small, the paper writes.
Oulu's Director of Public Health, Jorma Mäkitalo, told the paper that public fears over the risk were overblown.
""Come on now, people. Our country's leading, most experienced, independent vaccine and infection experts, after reviewing all the data, say the vaccine is safe with certain restrictions,"" he told Ilta-Sanomat.
While the vaccine remains in use for patients aged over 65, THL has halted distribution to younger recipients. The health body is due to make a decision on who can safely receive the vaccine next week, IS reports."

Police found the gathering at Läkkitori Square to be a religious public event, and suspended it for violating of restrictions on public gatherings. Police had not been notified of the event in advance.
After some time, police noted that public speaking was continuing and that people were still gathering at the site. The square is adjacent to the Galleria shopping centre, across the road from the Sello mall.
Police once again ordered the group to disperse and detained two people on suspicion of refusing to comply with police orders.
""The halting of the event went smoothly. Two people had to be taken into custody when orders were not followed. Force was not necessary,"" Detective Inspector Ilmari Hallamaa of the Western Uusimaa Police told Yle.
Public invitation
Based on a decision by the Regional State Administrative Agency for Southern Finland, public events with more than six people are prohibited until the end of April.
Commercial broadcaster MTV reports that the street worship service was organised by Espoon Kotikirkko (Espoo Home Church), which is part of the Finnish Baptist Church.
The group invited the public to join the event on its website, without any mention of coronavirus restrictions on group size.
Elsewhere on the site, the parish says that its events ""allow the possibility of maintaining safety distances"" and that ""the decision to wear a mask is up to each person's own understanding and conscience"" – but does not directly recommend either measure.
A day earlier, 20 people were detained in Helsinki for anti-restrictions protests that violated rules on public gatherings."

Among other issues, the party platform emphasises support for those who take care of family members with illnesses or disabilities at home.
In a speech on Sunday, party chair Marin said that criteria for subsidies for home caregivers should be harmonised throughout the country and that sufficient funds must be set aside for family care subsidies.
There are nearly 50,000 caregivers in Finland who have entered into family care contracts, and altogether some 350,000 people who care for relatives on a permanent basis.
More action against bullying and harassment 
Marin also highlighted actions against bullying and violence. According to Marin, the SDP wants an anti-bullying action programme to be drawn up in each municipality and its implementation to be monitored regularly.
“Schools must be safe places for everyone, and harassment and bullying in leisure time must also be addressed immediately, whether it is violence in the physical, mental or electronic world,” Marin said at the launch of the party's municipal election program in Helsinki.

Bullying and harassment not only affects children and young people, but also affects people’s willingness to participate in municipal decision-making, Marin noted.
""Recently, we have had reports of people quitting politics because of inappropriate behaviour in dealing with our common issues and debate. This must end. We may disagree, but every person must be respected,"" Marin said.
A study released last month indicated that the female leaders of Finland's governing parties have been the subject of a hate speech campaign on social media, and warned that this might discourage women in particular from entering politics.
SDP support slipping
The SDP was the last party to announce its municipal election programme. Advance voting begins just over a month and a half from now, on 26 May.
The latest Yle municipal election poll, released in early April, showed the SDP dropping to third place behind the two main opposition groups, the Finns Party and the National Coalition Party.
However, all three had support of 18-19 percent, with the differences between them well within the margin of error.
The three parties are also close together in numbers of parliamentary seats, with the SDP holding 40 seats and the two main opposition parties with 38 each.
Finland's longest serving female PM, Marin has held the office since December 2019, becoming party chair last August."

Officials warned members of the public not to approach the animal, but to report sightings to the emergency phone number, 112.
According to police, the latest confirmed sighting of the wolf was at about 11 am in the Laajalahti area of eastern Espoo.
Detective Inspector Ilmari Hallamaa of the Western Uusimaa Police told the news agency STT late Saturday that no new findings had been made since then.
""It is probably in the woods, and when it gets dark, it will hopefully be able to move to a more forested area,"" he said. Police said they would try to continue to monitor the wolf's whereabouts and behaviour.
According to police, the wolf had not approached people or behaved aggressively or dangerously, so was not believed to pose a danger to humans.
The tabloid Ilta-Sanomat obtained footage of an animal running through the Tali neighbourhood. Experts from the Natural Resources Institute (Luke) and the Helsinki Game Management Association confirmed to the paper that it was most likely a wolf.
Surprise during family stroll in Leppävaara
Satu Simola of Espoo was on a walk with her family in Leppävaara on Saturday, when a large canine ran by.
""My husband immediately said that it was a wolf,"" Simola said. ""It was clearly larger, the head larger, a wolf-shaped tail, and the general appearance was rougher. It went straight in the direction of Villa Elfvik,"" an environmental education centre on Espoo's eastern shore.
Simola says her family spends a lot of time out in nature and realised how rare it is to see a wolf.
""It was a really touching, amazing moment. Seeing such a wild animal inside the Ring I beltway really made you rub your eyes. It was a rare situation that doesn't happen every day,"" Simola told Yle.
The family's three small children, who were with her at the time, were eager to discuss wolves afterwards.
""We've talked today about our relationship with wildlife and how even though the wolf may look nice, it is still an unpredictable wild animal that needs to be given its own space,"" Simola said.
""Young lone wolf, left by its mother""
Hallamaa told the tabloid Iltalehti that the wolf's behaviour did not seem to be threatening to humans.
""The wolf has not growled or shown its teeth. On the contrary, it has apparently tried to escape from humans with its tail between its legs,"" Hallamaa said.
According to Hallamaa, wolf sightings in settled areas of the Helsinki metropolitan region are rare. He said police had discussed the animal with game management officials.
""Their view, and my own view, is that this appears to be a young lone wolf that has probably been left by its mother. The wolf may have strayed into the urban area while seeking a territory of its own. Hopefully it has decided that its territory won't be in the metropolitan area,"" he added.
Last year the Natural Resources Institute estimated Finland's population at 216-246 individuals in about 30 packs. A pack's average territory was 800-1200 square kilometres.
The last known killing of a human by a wolf in Finland was in 1882."

Henriksson said on Saturday that she would seek re-election at a party congress next month. She has led the centrist party since 2016. She faces no leadership challenge.
The SPP elects its chair and leadership for a year at a time. The party congress is to be held virtually on 29-30 May.
""The SPP will continue to be the party for everyone who cares about a bilingual Finland, liberal Western democracy, human rights and Nordic co-operation. We are the liberal, non-socialist alternative with a great social conscience,"" she said in a statement.
Dwindling minority
Henriksson said she wants to see the SPP grow as a party, pledging that it will earn more than five percent of seats in June's local elections.
The latest Yle poll showed the SPP support unchanged at 4.3 percent, by far the lowest among the five government parties.
The party primarily defends the interests of Finland's Swedish-speaking minority, which has been dwindling since the country gained independence. It fell below 10 percent in the 1930s and below six percent in the 1980s.
As of the end of 2019, native Swedish speakers made up 5.2 percent of the population – a share that was exceeded by speakers of foreign languages in the mid-2010s.

Opposition critical of election moves
Last month Henriksson sailed through a confidence vote in Parliament, brought by opposition parties critical of her handling of the postponement of municipal elections from April to June.
Henriksson, 57, is one of Finland's longest-serving justice ministers, having held the post in three cabinets, from 2011 to 2015 and again since mid-2019.

According to police, protesters who gathered on the Market Square and Narinkkatori Square were ordered to disperse.

Some 300 people had indicated they planned to attend via the event's Facebook page. It was scheduled to last until 4pm, but organisers did not file a notification with officials ahead of time as required by law.
Police said they were also monitoring a separate two-person demonstration in a park in front of the Parliament Annex (Pikkuparlamentti), which they had been informed of in advance.

According to a cabinet proposal unveiled on Friday, public events could start in a limited way in June if health safety can be ensured. In July, further restrictions would be lifted.'
Some European countries, including Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, have set up cancelation compensation funds for festivals, but so far the Finnish government has not made such a decision.
One of Finland's oldest and largest music events, Ruisrock Festival plans to announce in the coming weeks whether the festival will be held as planned in July. The festival arrangements will be made, at least for the time being, so that the event can be organised as planned in Ruissalo, Turku.
In 2019, the three-day festival drew crowds of about 105,000. Last year it was cancelled for the first time since its inception in 1970.
Ruisrock promoter Mikko Niemelä does not believe that rapid testing on-site as a prerequisite for admission is workable for such big events.
""The rapid testing proposals would probably concern events on a much smaller scale. I have not yet heard any international examples of a fully functioning system being found for big festivals when it comes to tens of thousands of visitors,"" he told Yle.
""There are still a lot of question marks in the air about what kind of restrictions there will be this summer. Social distancing is not really feasible for a festival like ours, where people come to be together,"" Niemelä said.
Flow: No final decision yet
No final decision has yet been made on whether Helsinki's Flow Festival will be stage this August, the festival's artistic director, Tuomas Kallio, said late Friday.
Earlier on Friday the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat reported that Flow would again be cancelled this summer, as it was last year.
""We have not made such a decision. We are trying to think about what kind of event could be possible, and the question is still open,"" Kallio said.

According to Kallio, measures related to possibly organising the festival will be decided in the near future.
""There's not much time, from our point of view. People who have bought tickets want to know soon,"" he said. In 2019 the three-day event attracted some 83,000 people.
According to Kallio, there is a strong desire to organise the festival in one way or another.
""There will be no normal festival this summer in Finland or in the world; that's useless speculation. International touring activities are at a standstill and this summer artists won't be touring,"" Kallio said.
""Festivals will have to be organised within the boundaries and conditions in which we now live. It remains to be seen how that will succeed,"" Kallio said.
More questions than answers in the air
In western Finland, Jaki Silvennoinen, who runs the Mustakari Memories in Kokkola and the Sun Pampas festival in Ylivieska, said that there are still more questions than answers in the air.

""First we need to be able to know what the allowed number of attendees will be and whether there must be certain distancing and masks. If they specify that there has to be hand sanitiser, that's one of the easiest things to organise,"" he said.
According to Silvennoinen, a decision will be made on the organisation of the June Sun Pampas festival within the next two weeks. The fate of Mustakari Memories, which will run in early July, is likely to be decided in May, once clearer instructions have been received. The 20th annual Mustakari Memories had 7,000 visitors in 2019.
""If they say that we can only admit 1,000 people, then we will probably not arrange it,"" Silvennoinen said.
Wait-and-see status for Kanta-Häme events 
Meanwhile organisers of major festivals in Kanta-Häme, south-central Finland, have not yet decided on organising next summer's events. Hämeenlinna's Wanaja Festival is awaiting more detailed instructions on how coronavirus restrictions will be lifted.
Production manager Jonna Myllykangas said that Wanaja Festival is still preparing for a possible festival next July.
In 2019, a total of 15,000 people attended the two-day Wanaja Festival, with all-domestic headliners such as J. Karjalainen, Kaija Koo and Ville Valo.

Simo Jaakkola, organiser of the Forssan Holjat city festival, said that his team is awaiting more detailed instructions this month. If more detailed instructions become available, preparations for the festival will begin in earnest in May.
Holjat has already signed some contracts with performers. If Holjat is held, singer-songwriter Arttu Wiskari will be one of this year's headliners. Holjat has traditionally been held in Forssa in early August.
Saaristo Open again postponed to June
Near Turku on the southwest coast, Kaarina's Saaristo Open was one of the few festivals held last summer, with an all-Finnish line-up of pop and rock acts. It plans to go ahead again this year, once again rescheduled from June to August.
Last year, Saaristo drew some of the summer's biggest crowds while following strict instructions laid down by the Regional State Administrative Agency for Southwest Finland, including distribution of face masks in the festival area.
""We strongly believe that this summer we will be able to enjoy live music in Finland's wonderful summer. The event will once again use the security measures that worked well last summer,"" the event's promoter, Kalle Keskinen, said in a press release.
This year, the Saaristo Open is to be a two-day event on the last weekend of August."

THL's figures for 2020 show that out of a total of 36,650 coronavirus infections in Finland, 30,424 were among working-age people. Of those, 2,601 were diagnosed in healthcare workers.
That number means medical workers accounted for 8.5 percent of all coronavirus infections among working-age people in Finland last year.
Figures from 2019 show that around 7.4 percent of working people are employed in the healthcare sector.
Most infections outside the workplace
THL found that in 30 percent of cases nursing staff contracted the virus at work. Thirty-three percent of infections came from close social contacts, for example from family members or circles of friends.
In 37 percent of cases among nursing staff the source of the infection remains unknown.
""As with many other workers for whom remote working is not possible, it can be difficult for healthcare workers to avoid social contact. For this reason, infections are possible on the way to work, in break rooms and in customer-facing situations if hygiene measures are not sufficient,"" THL infectious diseases specialist Tuula Hannila-Handelberg said in a statement.
Five percent of healthcare workers infected with the coronavirus were hospitalised. Of those, 18 percent were sent to intensive care.
There has been no reported case of a healthcare worker in Finland dying from the illness.
Infections spiked early on
The rates of infection among medical staff peaked in April and December 2020, reflecting trends seen among the general population.
Last April, they accounted for 17 percent of all coronavirus cases among working-age people in Finland.
""In the spring of last year there was high demand for hospital care and people were still getting used to the new protection measures. At the same time, testing was targeted both at at-risk groups and healthcare personnel, which partly explains the high proportion of infections last spring. In summer there were few infections in general, and the need for hospital care was low,"" Hannila-Handelberg said.
Women accounted for 82 percent of infections among healthcare workers last year, with men seeing 18 percent of cases. The gender divide in infections corresponds to the gender distribution of workers in the sector.
The median age of healthcare workers who caught the virus in 2020 was 40 years."

In March, the Ministry of Transport and Communications said it would look again at the law governing driving licences. In its blog, the ministry said it would ""assess what kind of legislative changes are needed to improve road safety for young people"".
""The starting point of the project is that, in general, young people should be able to travel safely and flexibly while the related administrative burden is reduced,"" said Monika Mutanen, a senior official at the Transport Ministry's Basic Services Unit.
""Among other issues, the project will assess the adequacy of teaching, tests and sanctions to improve traffic safety,"" Mutanen told Yle.
The revised law would likely take effect sometime next year.

 The driver's license process was last overhauled just three years ago. Ismo Pekkarinen / AOP
The Driving Licence Act, which came into force in mid-2018, reduced compulsory theory instruction and placed more emphasis on demonstrating competence in the driving test itself.
The 2018 reform was primarily motivated by the relatively high price of getting a driving licence, including the obligatory courses. The cost of obtaining a licence has dropped since the new legislation took effect.
More injuries to young drivers
Parliament asked the ministry to study the effects of the previous legislative reform, and the results were published in March. They showed that overall accidents involving young drivers decreased in 2019 and 2020, but that injuries to 17-year-old drivers rose last year.
The number of driving bans imposed on young people has also increased in recent years, although the number of people obtaining driving licences has fallen steadily. Only 54 percent of 18-year-olds now obtain a Class B driver’s licence.

The 2018 reform brought several changes.Yle Uutisgrafiikka
Last autumn police said that people aged 15-24 make up only about 12 percent of the population, but almost one in three people injured in road traffic is young.
Road Safety Council: Full driving rights should take effect in stages
The Finnish Road Safety Council, Liikenneturva, also sees a need for a reform of the law. It has its own suggestions on how safety for newly licenced drivers could be improved.
""One possibility would be to create a tiered driving licence, which would give young drivers certain limited rights,"" suggests Pasi Anteroinen, managing director of Liikenneturva.
""This could mean, for example, that in the first months after getting their licence, a young person would only be allowed to drive with an adult in the vehicle. The riskier situations could also be restricted, such as driving at night or with all other passengers being teenagers,"" Anteroinen said.
This type of model is already in use in Denmark, where the results have been good, Anteroinen said.
""In the longer term, road safety for young people has improved, but too slowly. We are significantly behind the other Nordic countries in this regard,"" he said.
Car association: Target those causing problems
Those approaching driving age are not likely to be enthusiastic about Liikenneturva's proposal. Nor is the Automobile and Touring Club of Finland (ATCF).
""The Driving Licence Act has been reformed quite a few times over the past decade, so I would like to see what the longer-term effects are and draw conclusions from that,"" said ATCF managing director Pasi Nieminen.
As Nieminen sees it, the biggest problem in tiered driving rights is that it would make it more difficult to get around, even for those who drive safely.
""Consideration should be given to driving bans and penalties for the group that is causing the problems. We should focus on that problems so that young people who behave responsibly are not targeted by unnecessary measures,"" Nieminen said.
Exemptions for 17-year-olds popular
The latest reform made it easier for a 17-year-old to get behind the wheel of a car. This was previously possible only under exceptional circumstances, for instance to get to school or work in areas with scant public transport.
Under the new, looser exemptions, about 30,000 driving licences have been issued to 17-year-olds, significantly more than was expected.
A 17-year-old can even obtain an exemption if he or she has received a traffic ban within the previous few years, for instance for dangerous use of a moped or motorbike.
""This is a clear area for improvement. If a driver has had a driving ban as a moped rider at the age of 15-16, he or she should not be granted an exemption for a passenger car at the age of 17,"" Anteroinen said.
Yle reported last autumn that aggravated speeding by young people increased after the driver's licence reform. Police in Lapland noted that many of those driving too fast were already known to police for earlier infractions related to moped or motorcycle use.
In a survey commissioned by Liikenneturva, only 26 percent of respondents thought that being able to drive a car at 17 was a positive change.
The changes in the law are part of a broader road safety strategy, preparation of which began in late 2019. This in turn is linked to an EU-wide goal of zero deaths in road transport by 2050."

Domestic producers say they have been able to plan with much more certainty than last spring, when it was unclear whether any foreign labourers would be allowed into the country.
The Jukkola family, whose farm in Kokkola on the west coast produces berries and carrots, is satisfied with the instructions received for hiring seasonal labour this time.
""The availability of labour was guaranteed early enough. Contracts were signed beginning in January. We've received good instructions from the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry on how to proceed,"" says farmer Elina Jukkola.
Coordinated charter flights
The Central Union of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners (MTK) launched its Töitä Suomesta (""Work in Finland"") service for seasonal agricultural workers in early 2019. Since the pandemic began, it has worked to arrange the coronavirus-safe entry of foreign labour. The MTK is coordinating direct weekly charter flights from Kiev, Ukraine to Finland.
""The first flights have already arrived, and they will continue until the end of June,"" said MTK Director of Business Development Marko Mäki-Hakola.
He said that the charter flights and the transport of workers to their workplaces are Covid-safe. Each worker must have a certificate indicating a recent negative coronavirus test.
""When workers arrive in Finland, they are transported directly to their workplaces in a corona-safe way and quarantined on the premises,"" explained Mäki-Hakola. They are tested again after arriving in Finland.
About 3,000 labourers came on chartered flights last year. This year, it is estimated that more than 10,000 seasonal workers will arrive from abroad. Most are expected from Ukraine, Russia and Thailand.
Food served during quarantine
Twenty seasonal workers from Ukraine are coming to work on the Jukkola family farm.
""We will have three different groups at different times, and everyone will have their own space. We get food for them during the quarantine period, when they stay in their own premises,"" says Jukkola.
Last year there were some Covid-19 outbreaks related to groups of foreign labourers, including at greenhouses, a shipyard and a wind farm.
Jukkola says that this year each farm must draw up a health and safety plan together with the chief infection doctor of the local hospital district.
Seasonal work for thousands
As of the beginning of April, the Finnish Immigration Service had approved some 7,300 applications for seasonal work certificates, and there were another 1,200 applications awaiting processing. A seasonal work certificate entitles the holder to work in Finland for up to 90 days.
About 460 seasonal work residence permits, on the other hand, have been issued and there are 470 applications in the queue. This permit entitles a worker to stay for 3-9 months.

In total, the bank accounts of Finnish households grew by more than eight billion euros over the course of the pandemic.
However, not all of the country's residents were lucky enough to have cash surpluses, as many faced furloughs or layoffs. According to Nordea Bank economist Juho Kostiainen., people who were able to keep their jobs found that the opportunities to spend had diminished.
""Of course, some have made investments. Shares, funds and homes have traded this year and some money went towards things like that and not just to bank accounts,"" Kostiainen said.

At the end of February, the annual growth rate of household bank deposits was more than nine percent, according to figures from the Bank of Finland. At the same time, the total amount in Finnish household bank accounts reached a record high of 104.7 billion euros.
The vast majority of those funds were being kept in nearly zero-percent interest rate current accounts. At the end of February, there was a total of around 94.5 billion euros in such accounts.
Year-on-year, the household savings rate increased by 5.7 percent last year. According to Statistics Finland, savings levels have not been that high since the crippling recession of the 1990s.
The savings rate is the ratio of household savings to net disposable income — if the savings rate is positive, then households have not yet consumed all of their income and saved it instead.
Back to 'normal': What might happen?
Promises by the government to gradually begin lowering restrictions once the epidemic is under control has led some to wonder if there will be a major growth in spending by consumers.
""Last summer, when the coronavirus situation eased for a while, in the third quarter, private consumption grew by eight percent compared to the previous quarter. We will certainly see that same type of growth once restrictions are lifted,"" Kostiainen predicted.
""Once the borders and restaurants open up, people will start consuming,"" he noted, adding that many consumers will still likely keep some money in their accounts as a buffer as they examine their economic and employment situations in the long term.
Then, he said, as outlooks improve, people will begin to dare dip into their savings. However, it might take a year before economic and employment issues become clearer, so consumers' bank accounts will not be emptied all at once, according to Kostiainen.
Some economists reckon consumer spending will grow as Finland's vaccination programme progresses and as restrictions are lifted during the second half of the year.
Hannu Nummiaro, a private economist from insurance firm LähiTapiola, said that the country's journey towards herd immunity from coronavirus has already begun but a return to normal will still take time.

""On the other hand, many won't get their second vaccination dose until well into the autumn and that may mean the summer will be quite similar as last year — isolated and domestically focused. In other words, a broader recovery in consumption levels will probably not be seen until towards the end of the year,"" Nummiaro said."

Prosecutors allege that he stabbed a man over a five-euro note.
The charges the boy faces, which became public on Monday, include attempted robbery, attempted murder, robbery, and traffic safety violations.
If found guilty he would face a custodial sentence.
In February the boy was sentenced to nine years and four months in prison by Helsinki District Court in February for his part in the killing of an 18-year-old man in Vallila, Helsinki, on 31 October last year.
At the time of the Vallila killing, the boy was subject to a travel ban after being arrested on 6 October in Tampere. He was released on 23 October.
The new charges concern a series of incidents that are alleged to have taken place on 3 October in Tampere and Loimaa.
3 October 2020 timeline
According to prosecutors, the 16-year-old, along with a 15-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl, were driving in the 15-year-old boy's mother's car in Tampere on 3 October.
They encountered the alleged victim in Tampere's Kaukajärvi neighbourhood. The 16-year-old is accused of approaching a man, armed with a knife. The boy admitted to asking the man for five euros, after which the man threw a glass at him.
The boy denies attempting aggravated robbery.
According to prosecutors, the alleged victim told the boy three times he had no money. In an incident caught on camera, the man fell to the ground and was stabbed in the upper torso, right thigh and lower right leg.
The court indictment says that the three youths then fled the area by car. They are also accused of stealing nearly 50 litres of fuel from a petrol station.
The 16-year-old is also accused of driving a car on a public road without a licence. Prosecutors say he was speeding and failed to stop at a stop sign. The boy then lost control of the car and crashed into a field, injuring one of the 15-year-olds.
The three are also accused of trespassing in a sauna building and staying the night.
Prosecutors seek a fine for the 15-year-old girl and a suspended sentence for the 15-year-old boy."

""About 200,000 vaccines will come to Finland this and next week and all of the vaccines coming to the country will be able to be administered,"" Kontio said on Monday.
According to estimates from hospital districts around the country, Finland has the capacity to administer up to 600,000 doses of the coronavirus vaccine per week.
But Kontio said such a large volume of the jabs may not actually be available in the country. However, as more vaccines are expected to arrive the vaccination rate will begin to increase towards the end of this month. In May, Finland will administer around 300,000 jabs per week, Kontio said.
""During June, the estimate is between 300,000-400,000 doses per week. I'm not quite sure about July, but it may be that vaccine volumes will increase then,"" she said.
Earlier this year, health authorities estimated that everyone who wanted a coronavirus vaccine would be able to receive at least one of two doses by the end of June or in early July. Kontio said that estimate still stands.
Mia Kontio
Rollout expectations
According to THL's vaccination rollout estimates, increasing amounts of the Pfizer Biontech jabs will arrive in Finland during the spring and early summer, with about 150,000 doses arriving weekly.
A total of about 200,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine are expected to arrive this month, but only people 65 years of age and older are receiving those, due to blood clot concerns.
Another coronavirus vaccine produced by US firm Johnsson & Johnsson, received approval from European authorities last month.
Kontio said Finland is expecting to receive about 20,000 doses of the Johnsson & Johnsson jabs per week by the end of this month.
Additionally, about 80,000 doses of the Moderna-made vaccine are expected to arrive per month, in deliveries every two weeks.
Meanwhile, a vaccine made by German pharmaceutical firm Curevac is expected to receive approval by European regulators in the summer.
The Curevac jab, like the one made by Pfizer Biontech, is an mRNA vaccine which differs from traditional vaccines in that it does not contain the coronavirus itself but instead uses the pathogen's genetic code.
""It is estimated that Curevac will probably receive marketing authorisation in June. The company has announced it will prepare vaccines in advance [of the approval], so it is possible that Curevac will be in use in late June or early July,"" Kontio explained.
Strategies and plans
However, the anticipated timetables are still linked to deliveries arriving on schedule, Kontio noted.
She said that vaccinations for Finland's at-risk groups will be completed by mid-May, when vaccinations of working age people are expected to begin.
The country's vaccine expert group, Krar, is scheduled to meet on Tuesday to discuss the current age limits on the AstraZeneca jabs.
Kontio said that if the group recommends that AstraZeneca's vaccine be limited to people over the age of 65, it is likely that Finland would soon stop using it.
""In addition to the European Medicines Agency's assessment, [AstraZeneca] is also being assessed by Finland together with other European and Nordic countries,"" she said.
There has also been discussion about whether Finland should target vaccinations regionally, to areas hardest-hit by the epidemic, but a final decision has not yet been made.
Kontio said that targeting vaccines could still be a useful strategy in the spring and summer.
""The impact of targeting would decrease if large quantities of vaccines arrived in the country,"" she noted.
As of Monday 12 April, 2021, just over 20 percent of Finland's population had received at least one of two coronavirus vaccine doses, according to THL.

Finland recorded 5,973 new coronavirus cases over the past two weeks, which is 3,102 fewer cases seen during the previous fortnight, according to the data.
In total, more than 82,200 coronavirus cases have been diagnosed in Finland since the start of the epidemic last year.
As of Monday, Finland's coronavirus incident rate was just over 107 cases per 100,000 residents over a two-week period.
The largest number of the country's cases continue to be in the hospital districts of Helsinki and Uusimaa, but also Southern Savo and Päijät-Häme.
However, the incident rate for new cases has fallen sharply, particularly in the Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District. Meanwhile, new case numbers also went down in Päijät-Häme.
Meanwhile, in the hospital district of Eastern Savo case numbers have risen over the past two weeks from 35 to 202, but due to the area's small number of roughly 40,000 residents, the figures can quickly change in either direction within a short period of time.
Finland's lowest coronavirus incident rate as of Monday was in the Lapland Hospital District, where the ratio was 10.2 cases per 100,000 residents over the past two weeks."

The paper says it has obtained a proposal that the ministry made to a tripartite working group on pay transparency.
Labour market issues in Finland are often settled in so-called tripartite talks between unions, employers' organisations and the government.
In this working group, HS reports that the ministry appears to be advocating a model whereby an employee who suspects discrimination based on gender can demand information about colleagues' compensation.
Employers would have to hand it over, if gender discrimination was the suspected reason, according to HS.
The employee requesting the data would be subject to a confidentiality agreement, but would be able to pass on the salary information to staff representatives, unions, lawyers or police.
In addition, staff representatives' right to data on pay would be expanded.

Officials at the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs say that queues for hip, cataract and knee surgery have all grown since the pandemic began occupying medical staff last year.
There are now some 3,000 patients in the Helsinki and Uusimaa hospital district who have waited longer than six months for surgery. That compares to a figure of 1,230 patients from before the Covid pandemic struck.
That does not tell the whole story, as referrals from general practitioners have come at a slower rate than before the pandemic. That suggests that some people are not seeking help for their problems.
In addition, there is likely to be a substantial need for help with mental health, substance abuse and chronic illness problems that have been neglected over the last year.
There are two main reasons for that. The first is the number of health centres that have been converted to Covid testing and contact tracing operations, which has constricted the availability of appointments.
The second is people's own behaviour. A lot of people have delayed seeking help so as not to bother doctors and nurses while they have a pandemic to tackle.
HS quotes the head of HUS psychiatry services Jesper Ekelund as saying that he's concerned about young people who have seen little of their friends in recent months.
That's a problem, he says, that will have an impact in 2.5-3 years.
Survey: Local poll not a referendum
The Uutissuomalainen newspaper group has a poll that suggests a majority don't see the upcoming local elections as a referendum on whether the government can continue in office.
Some 61 percent of respondents said the election result should not be linked to the Marin government's survival, with 19 percent of the opposite opinion and 20 percent on the fence.
The Finns party has frequently linked continuation of the government's term in office with the local elections, which are due to take place on 13 June.
The theory is that a poor performance from the Centre Party could tempt the party to collapse the government to try and recover lost support.
Centre party support is under pressure from the Finns Party in many rural areas.

Mask collecting in Nurmijärvi
Ilta-Sanomat reports on a runner from Nurmijärvi who has managed to collect some 4,000 face masks discarded during the pandemic.
Last August Kaisu Paulanto had noticed an accumulation of the face coverings on the ground during her runs through central Uusimaa, and decided a while ago that it would make sense to pick them up.
So now she dons gloves, shoves the respiratory protectors into a plastic bag and then deposits them in the bin.
She's kept count over the last six months, and it seems like she's gathered some 4,000 masks chucked away by Nurmijärvi's careless litterbugs.
THL advises people to put used face masks in the bin without touching the outside surfaces, and to wash hands before and after mask removal."

Posti CEO Turkka Kuusisto acknowledged two extensive delivery disruptions of packages addressed to the National Archives in Helsinki, both of which occurred this year. In both cases the address labels on the parcels were lost during transport.
It was previously reported that one of the packages went missing for months after being sent.
The National Archive did not specify what kind of materials were contained in the parcel, apart from that it was historically-important research from the 1940s and 1960s. The package was sent from Jyväskylä in January and finally arrived nearly three months later.
""The second of these [parcels] was a locked transport box sent from Jyväskylä to Helsinki. The delivery was significantly delayed, which was a clear mistake on our part,"" Kuusisto said in a statement.
However, the CEO noted that while the package took a long time to arrive, it was always in Posti's secure premises and was delivered to the National Archive last week.
Also last week, the Minister for European Affairs and Ownership Steering, Tytti Tuppurainen (SDP), said she wanted an explanation about the parcels' temporary disappearance as well as information about the quality and reliability of Posti's services.
The minister's intervention was prompted by an announcement by the National Archives that it planned to stop using Posti for internal deliveries due to missing packages and severe delays.
Earlier this month, National Archive Director Päivi Hirvonen said that only about four percent of the Archive's contents had been digitalised so far, and that the institution planned to increase that amount.
""Due to the disappearance of the delivery, we will invest even more in digitising material in the future, so that we will be able to stop sending [materials],"" she said."

The case will be heard by Jyväskylä District Court on 19 May.
The charges of assault and making an illegal threat are related to an incident in the city on 24 May last year, which the prosecutor alleges began when a man made a comment to Torssonen's spouse. The man had allegedly said that the councillor had put up posters around Jyväskylä harbour.
The man alleges that Torssonen then confronted him over the comments later in the day at a separate location. According to both him and a witness at the scene, Torssonen struck the man in the head with a stone that he had taken from his pocket. The victim of the alleged assault said he tried to defend himself from this attack by using his legs to push himself away from Torssonen.
In response to this allegation, Torssonen has counter-alleged that he himself was the victim of the attack, and claimed he was only defending himself.
Both were suspected of assault during the pre-trial investigation, but the prosecutor dropped the case against the other man.
Regional prosecutor Janne Kangas decided that, based on the witness accounts, the evidence suggested Torssonen was waiting for the man because of what had happened earlier in the day and he attacked the alleged victim, who tried to defend himself.
Torssonen told Yle that the prosecutor's decision is incorrect.
""I'm really amazed that this can be turned completely on its head,"" Torssonen said.
Police suspect Torssonen staged car vandalism
Shortly after this incident, the police ordered Torssonen to deliver his shotgun, pistol and a bird rifle to authorities, which is standard practice when the holder of a firearms licence is suspected of a crime.
However, according to police, Torssonen informed them his car had been broken into and his firearms had been stolen from it.
Yle previously reported in February that police suspect Torssonen staged the break-in to the car. Jyväskylä-based newspaper Keskisuomalainen published pictures at the time showing a broken rear window, spray paint on the car, and a note attached to the windscreen wipers. The note read ""nazi pig and whore it was your last act"".
Doubts about the break-in arose during the police's investigation into Torssonen's suspected involvment in the attempted murder of Finns Party aide Pekka Kataja last July. The weapons were found by officers in the possession of one of Torssonen's acquaintances during a search of an address in a different part of the country.
Story continues after the photo.

Police then began to suspect that Torssonen had asked his friend to collect his weapons and vandalise the car, which belonged to Torssonen's mother.
During the course of the investigation, Torssonen's mother announced that she was withdrawing her claim for damages. which led to the prosecutor closing the case.
However, the alleged staging of the break-in may be the subject of a future court case.
""At this stage, I have not taken a position on the allegations of staging the break-in,"" regional prosecutor Kangas said.
Torssonen strongly denies any involvement in the car break-in, as well as the firearms offence."

Vaccine producers around the world are now testing their jabs on teens and children. Last week, pharma firm Pfizer applied to US regulators to lower the age limit for its coronavirus vaccine from the current 16 years old to 12.
Meanwhile, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson are also testing their respective coronavirus vaccines on children and youths. However, AstraZeneca has ceased trials on individuals under 18 years of age following investigations that revealed links between its vaccine and blood clots.
If the European Medicines Agency (EMA) lowers the age limit for Pfizer's jab to 12, it would mean that as many youths who are willing could be vaccinated by the time summer break is over, according to Rämet.
That would mean youngsters between the ages of 12 to 15 would be able to return to classrooms, he said.
""I think it's important that all primary, high school, vocational and college students return to in-person education settings immediately when the school year begins again this autumn. Pfizer's vaccine is very effective in young people, so there is no obstacle in vaccinating them,"" Rämet said.
However, he said that kids under the age of 12 will likely have to wait until next year to be vaccinated. One possibility, Rämet said, was that the coronavirus jab would become part of the national vaccination programme for young children.
Future boosters possible
Most of the coronavirus vaccines currently available are administered in two doses. Rämet said that the first dose provides good protection while the second strengthens it. As variants of the virus arrive, vaccines will be further developed, he explained.
""We will probably need a dose within six months or a year after the first doses. But at that stage, production capacities will already be so good that there won't be supply problems,"" Rämet said.
So far, coronavirus infections have generally only caused minor side-effects among children. When asked whether it was appropriate to give kids coronavirus vaccines, Rämet said the question was whether vaccines are safe for children.
""Children deserve medicines and vaccines that have been tested on children,"" he said, adding that Covid-19 has not been completely harmless to kids.
He pointed out that thousands of kids around the world who contracted Covid-19 suffered hyperinflammation triggered by the virus, a condition which can cause high fever, heart failure and in the worst case, even death. However, fatalities are very rare.
He said that from an immunological perspective, there were no differences between kids and adults. Immediate reactions to the vaccine are the same: jabs can cause temporary fever and pain at the injection site in both children and grownups.
The important thing is to determine the right dosage for children of various ages, but such research takes time as age groups undergo trials individually.
Rämet said he disagreed with the notion of vaccinating kids in order for adults to reach herd immunity.
""That must absolutely not be the driving force behind vaccinating children,"" he said.
""The best way to protect yourself against Covid-19 is to take the vaccine when it is offered. Covid-19 is not going anywhere for a long time, so it will pay off to get vaccinated,"" Rämet said."
