♪ Born To Be Mild ♪





Once upon a time in a kingdom far, far away, called Orlando, Florida, there lived a girl who was not a princess, for she was born fat.

According to the legend, even the hospital staff had appeared a little stunned that this newborn was not so tiny. A nurse had had trouble depositing her in her mother's arms. The mother, worried about the cause, cast a look down at the innocent infant and frowned.

"This can't be my daughter," were the first words the baby heard. Of course, she had no recollection of it herself. The only reason she knew was because it was one of her mother's favorite stories.

You see, the mother had been a beautiful 22 year old woman in her prime, poised to become the next Selena of the Latino world in America. Until she'd gotten pregnant with her manager, the man who had taken her out of her native Venezuela with promises of fame and richness. And had dumped her to the curb as soon as the news of pregnancy had been delivered to him.

So, don't think that the mother was a callous woman. She hadn't been entirely happy about the circumstances. It couldn't have been easy for her to muster love and warmth when feeling abandoned and fooled by the man she'd entrusted her entire future to.

The mother, one Victoria Cecilia de la Cruz Vazquez, had grown up in the land of the most beautiful women on earth, being one of them. Since she was a child, her heart had been filled to bursting with compliments from relatives and strangers about how bright her smile was, how wonderful her big, green eyes were, or her glossy, straight hair, and as she grew up, about her hourglass figure.

But being praised for her one true love, singing, was ultimately her reason for living. And she'd thought she could make a good living out of it, too. She left her parents and siblings and moved to the land of the American dream to pursue her version of it. She envisioned herself on a stage in front of thousands of people, singing in Spanish or English, it didn't matter, as long as her voice reached far and wide. As long as the applause was all for her.

And it all went up in a puff of smoke thanks to a single night of abandon.

Fast forward nine months and the baby in her arms was not a bundle of joy. It was a symbol of all she'd lost with one stupid mistake, and on top of that, didn't even look like her.

When telling the story to friends and relatives, Victoria laughed as if it was a funny one with a happy ending. "Then she started wailing right there in my arms and I started growing hysterical when it dawned on me that, Dios mío, I was suddenly a mother and I didn't even know how to take care of myself. Her screams were so loud that the doctor and the nurses ran away from the room. But at that moment I realized she was mine, because even though she didn't have my face or my hair or even the color of my eyes, she definitely had my lungs."



So this girl, the non princess, grew up using her lungs the same way her mother did. To belt out in song.

Vera Maria de la Cruz Vazquez grew up being known in her barrio for two things: one, that she was fat, and two, that she could sing anything, anywhere, any time.

In case you were wondering, that was my story.

The only thing I share in common with my ma is that we both love music. Even after I was born and she realized that she couldn't keep the same lifestyle of working at weddings, parties and singing at clubs while taking care of me, she never abandoned her talent. She wouldn't read me books when I was a kiddy; she'd sing me songs from her youth. I grew up on Olga Tañón, Selena and old acts like Las Chicas del Can, that nobody seemed to know. And I mimicked her, because what else are you supposed to do when you were six years old, and those were the only moments you saw your ma's eyes fill with genuine delight and pride that you were in her life.

As I grew older and it became more apparent that my baby fat was there to stay, this dynamic changed. I'd join her in a song and after, her eyes would dim and she'd click her tongue.

"Ay mija, what a shame. If only you were a bit slimmer you could make my dream come true." She'd stand before me, brushing a mass of curls away from my face and looking me up and down in my entire 16 size glory. "Why don't we get you in a diet? With a few pounds less you could become quite pretty."

And she meant well, that was the thing. This was her way of saying I had talent but that it wasn't enough. So I'd try to diet to make her happy, to keep the pride for me glowing in her eyes. But every time I tried it felt like fighting a losing battle. I'd get so hungry that I felt like I'd pass out, and I was so miserable that we both had to stop. Rinse and repeat, at least once per year. It became harder for me to sing my heart out to her if it always led to this.

Then she got a new reason for being happy when she met a gringo that made her feel like she was special again. I guess we should've counted ourselves lucky, because thanks to them getting married my ma became a legal resident and was able to graduate from cleaning houses and businesses in our poor community to cleaning the houses of the rich in Winter Park. I should have been happy, too, but at 12 I was old enough to think it was kinda weird that my ma was the one working long hours and weekends, while my step father lounged around at home every day, drinking beer, and going to bars with his buds at night.

Then my ma got pregnant again. Baby Victor was an average weight and pretty baby, and more importantly, the son of the gringo. My relevance to ma moved down to third position. And then fourth when she decided to start her own housecleaning business, and she only paid me enough attention when she was short of a cleaning girl for a job. Then music became her fifth priority, because the gringo didn't like songs in Spanish, and she had to juggle a newborn and a business.

I, being the pushover that I was, simply stopped singing.

There was no point in trying to, when the only audience you cared about was too busy with anything else. When there weren't that many reasons in life to fill it with music.

All I could do after that was focus on school and hope that a good GPA took me far away, into a land where I could be myself, with no scrutiny on my size, or the texture of my hair, or the look in the gringo's face that wondered what I was even doing in the picture every time he looked at me. The look that made me feel like an outsider and like, just maybe, my ma would have been better off without me from the start.

So I, Vera Maria de la Cruz Vazquez, daughter of an ex-singer, became known in my barrio for a third thing: excellent grades. And when the Catholic boarding school for rich kids, Holy Trinity High School, announced a full ride scholarship for an underprivileged child, I decided that that was my ticket out of dodge.

I applied for the opening one summer night, wishing upon a shooting star that this would change my life — not knowing that this shooting star was not just a burning piece of rock entering the atmosphere and burning up to ashes, but the maker of an absolutely outrageous miracle.

♪ My Way or Take a Hike ♪

♪ My Way or Take a Hike ♪ When your life is more about the stick than the carrot, you expect to be hit by the damn carrot too.

This programming was so engrained in me that I was not shocked that ma forgot I had the Trinity High interview screening on the day not one, but two of her girls flaked out of cleaning a mansion in Winter Park. And she thought I could just sub in. No problem.

"Problem," I told her as she tried to usher me out of the gringo's house. "I have my interview today."

My mum brushed her sleek hair back and rested her hand on the neat bun at the top of her head, looking at me like I was speaking in tongues. Her blue maid uniform was crisp and clean, and it took her a few seconds to realize I was wearing my church dress instead of the maid one. She looked down all the way to the only pair of strappy sandals I owned.

"Vera Maria," she started in the same tone of voice she used to scold me for eating too much. "What in the world are you talking about and why aren't you in your uniform?"

My cheek twitched, and I couldn't begin to say if it was because I wanted to smile in that awkward way people do when encountered with an uncomfortable situation, or if it was because I wanted to scream.

You know what? It was totally the latter.

"Ma, I can't join you today. I have the interview at noon."

She put her hands on her hips with the same look her face took on before she bent down to take out the chancla. "It's 8am, we'll be done before your thing. And besides, we'll be close by."

I fiddled with the hem of my dress. The last part was true, at least. "Yes, but we definitely won't be done before my interview. This house was supposed to be a whole day job with three people and now we're two."

Her chin jutted out. "Exactly, and if you don't help me it will only be me, and it either will take me an entire week to clean a seven bedroom home with six and a half bathrooms and a pool house, or I'll have to drop the job last minute and lose the client. Which is it gonna be?"

"Ay, ma," I said with a cringe. I hated when she made me feel small and stupid. "I'm sorry, I just-"

She turned around and grabbed her bag and basket of supplies. "Get changed and I'll wait for you in the car."

"But, ma-"

With a glance over her shoulder she said, "Don't worry, you won't miss your interview. I don't know why you even want to try to suck up to those fancy people because they won't accept you, but I'll let you try so that at least I can tell you te lo dije afterwards."

te lo dije My lips pursed to hold back the words I'd have liked to say, but I've never talked back at my ma and I wouldn't start on the day I needed her to cooperate the most. I just nodded and went back into my room, quickly changing into my maid uniform and putting my nice clothes in a bag to bring with me. I was determined to look my best for the interview because, even though they knew I came from this neck of the woods based off of my application, the interviewers at least had to know that I was a responsible person who made an effort. And ma was, too, which was why I couldn't just tell her that no, I wouldn't help because my plans were more important than hers.



I sat on the passengers' seat and we didn't speak a word the entire ride. I pulled the masses of curls atop my head into as best a tight bun as I could and that served to distract me. It was a good thing, too, because I was sure to work up a sweat and didn't want my hair to get all sticky and limp.

I watched as the scenery changed from the small and run down houses of our barrio to old and affluent ones. When I was younger I used to imagine the kind of people who lived in each of the houses. A blue Victorian style house definitely was owned by a couple of hot shot surgeons. The yellow ranch style overseeing the lake was the property of a Hollywood superstar who only visited once during the summers, and loved to spend time at the parks incognito. We almost never met the people we cleaned houses for and ma never told me if she knew who they were. It was much more fun to just fill in the blanks in my mind.

She took a left in the middle of the road and drove through massive iron gates. All we could see was a sprawling garden with old, but well maintained plants that hid the house from view of the outside. I had the impression we were in a country estate, rather than in the middle of Orlando. She finally parked the car where I assumed was the back of the house, because even though I could tell it was an impressive building it didn't have the fanfare I'd expect for what a grand entrance should be.

I helped ma offload the car and transport the cleaning supplies inside. She gave me instructions on what to watch out for, where to start and to call her at least half an hour before the interview.

"And remember, chiquita," she said, using my childhood nickname to give me what I assumed was a false sense of security. "If you see any of the owners don't look them directly in the eye, don't talk to them except to greet or apologize and move out of their way."

I sighed. This was probably the hundredth time she said the same speech and I was sure I could repeat it verbatim back at her. "Sí, ma."

We started upstairs. Her logic always was to clean the most personal spaces first, so that the clients could return to enjoy them right away. We started from the left wing, where ma went into the master's suite and I went to a different room. This one was larger than our entire house and I couldn't imagine how much bigger was the master's. I had a feeling it'd take me an entire day to make this room spotless and the feeling of despair that I'd sure miss my interview washed over me. I squeezed my hand tight around the duster and swore to myself that I wouldn't miss it, no matter what, not even if this room turned out to be filthiest on earth. I had to escape for the interview and then I could come back and clean until the sunrise if necessary.

With that determination I headed to the bathroom first because my personal philosophy was to finish up the parts I hated the most first, that way I had a lot less to complain about for the rest of the job. I was pleasantly surprised when I found that it wasn't super nasty. One could almost enjoy cleaning when everything was already spotless.

my I put on gloves and set out to get the shower and tub done with first. I went over the questions Leti, my best friend, had helped me practice for last night. When they asked me why I believed I was the right candidate for the open placement, I had to make my life story sound way worse than it was. Like I was some sort of Cinderella waiting for her shot, and that this was it. As I scrubbed the walls of the shower that probably had capacity for an entire classroom, I kinda thought of myself as one. Except that there were no friendly mice to help me. Or a crab under the sea. Or seven dwarfs.

I snorted and said, "If anything, I'm the dwarf." I put my hands on my hips. "But at least I can sing like a princess."

The chorus to A Whole New World came to my mind and I belted it out. The acoustics in this bathroom were fantastic and I wondered if the owner used it as a recording studio.

"Nice voice."

I screamed and turned around so fast that the entire world spun. I fell back against the soapy wall, holding my chest as if it could keep my heart from jumping out, for the most beautiful creature stood before me. And he was wearing only pants and no shirt.

He lifted both hands in a defensive gesture. "Whoa, are you okay? I didn't mean to scare you."

What were ma's rules again? Right, not look at the clients directly. But I already had, and the face of an Abercrombie model in the flesh was not something one could forget easily. Or the sight of his sculpted upper body. But I still looked down and saw that even his bare feet were pretty.

"I'm sorry, sir," I said and cringed at myself because I sounded breathless. "I didn't mean to intrude, I'll leave now."

"No, no, you're good. I'm the one who's not supposed to be here." I made the mistake of looking up at him as he brushed the auburn hair off of his forehead. He huffed. "Please don't tell anybody you saw me."

My lips were sealed, and not because I wanted them to be, they just couldn't recover their movement. So I nodded.

His own lips curled into a smile that reached grey eyes. "Right, I'm just going to skip over to my brother's bathroom before I take off. If you see him, don't tell him I was here."

I nodded again, not having a clue what was going on. He bent down to grab the t-shirt he'd dumped on the floor and left without a further word. I turned back to face the soapy wall that somewhat now had my silhouette imprinted on it. I jumped out of the shower and raced to the mirror, cursing aloud as I confirmed that the back of my hair was now a soapy mess. I'd have to do some serious improvising before the interview. My dark skin looked flushed and it wasn't because of physical exertion. I'd only just got started working. That stupid hot boy screwed me over in the, like, 20 seconds I saw him.

It was unfair how rich people were good looking on top of having boatloads of money. And to keep the money rolling in and not out they were probably smart, too. And those were precisely the kind of people I had to impress in order to get into that school. I definitely couldn't come across as a resentful person. And I wasn't, not to them at least. The gringo was poor, not a looker and definitely not smart, but he sure soaked up all the resentment I had in me.

"Where was I?" I muttered to myself as I stepped back into the shower. I picked up the sponge and kept scrubbing, recalling my previous train of thought before the song had burst forward. I cleaned and practiced my answers, and the hours passed me by without me noticing until my ma came running at me as I was vacuuming a hallway.

"Vera Maria!" she screamed so loud that I could hear her over the noise. I turned the machine off and turned to her. "Don't you have the interview in ten minutes?"

I nearly passed out. "Oh my God."

"You better run, mija, or I won't get to say I told you so at all."

I ran like the cops were chasing me.

I didn't even look at my watch to see if I was completely screwed. I just kept going and almost got ran over at a stop sign. But the car had the stop and I didn't, so I kept going. Ma had been right that we were close to the school, but on foot it felt like it was at a different freaking country and I wasn't exactly the fittest person around. By the time I made it to the front gate I was drenched in sweat and was having so much trouble breathing that I couldn't even tell the guard my name.

"Jesus Christ, girl." He was an older hispanic man. "Deep breaths, I need you to be able to tell me what your business is here so that I can usher you in or out."

I nodded and held my palm up, asking for a second. I drew in gasps of air and finally said my name. He blinked at me.

"I'm here for the interview."

His brows drew together. "I didn't think we were looking for cleaning crew anymore."

I shook my head. "No, as a student."

I could tell he had trouble processing that and my maid uniform together. But still, he walked back into the little room he had at the front and pulled up a paper. "Vera Maria de la Cruz Vazquez?"

"Yes." I pulled myself up and tried to straighten my clothes. "That's me."

"You're ten minutes late."

My stomach plummeted all the way to the floor and I felt my eyes sting with tears like it was a party trick and I wanted to impress.

"Did I... lose my chance?"

He shifted his weight from one leg to the other. "Well, I don't know. That's not for me to say. Let me make a call."

I willed my eyes to suck back the tears to no avail, they started to roll down my cheeks in fat rivers. I wiped them away furiously, mad at myself. I singlehandedly fulfilled my earlier fear that ma would make me miss the interview. It'd actually been her who realized what had been about to happen and tried to prevent it. How stupid could a person be to flush their dream down the toilet in such a careless way?

"No. Yes," he said on the phone to someone, looking at me with clear cut pity. "She's here. It looks like she's had some... difficulties."

To put it mildly.

He started nodding to the phone. "Yes, yes. Good. Right away, ma'am." He hung up and turned to me. "They'll give you a chance."

My knees almost gave in right then. "Thank God," I said. My lips were trembling. As I followed the guard past the gates I told myself I had to kick ass during this interview. They were already coming into it with a bad first impression, all my fault, and it was also on me to erase that and win them over.



The thought of that made me nauseous. It wasn't something I'd ever achieved. I wasn't confident or charming and the only times I ever managed to gain some sort of admiration from people was when I sang. But these people were not here to hear me sing, they were here to hear me speak and make my case about why it'd benefit them to take me as charity.

No pressure.

Nervous as I was, I couldn't appreciate my surroundings. I suddenly developed the vision of a horse, only able to see ahead of me to where the guard guided me. As if he were the carrot that was being dangled toward my goal. My mind suddenly drew blank even as he led me through the hallways of the most sumptuous building I'd ever stepped foot in. He stopped at a set of giant oak doors and knocked. The wood seemed so thick I couldn't understand how anybody inside could hear, but only a second later a nun opened the door.

I'd only ever seen a nun on TV, because my ma and I hadn't grown up as faithful or regular church goers. But I couldn't say this aloud.

She was really young, I noticed as she smiled. "You must be Vera."

The guard leaned a bit closer to the nun. "Be nice to her, the poor girl came in running on foot."

The word poor was so on point it was almost like he knew me and my family.

poor The nun said, "We're always fair."

It took me a second as I was walked into the room to realize she hadn't said they'd be nice to me. But fair. Fair meant they were definitely going to consider my lateness. I was screwed.

I stood in front of another nun, older and with an air of authority, that sat by a man with crinkles on the corners of his eyes.

"Please take a seat," the younger nun said, pointing at a plump chair they had in the middle of the room. Once I sat and she joined as well, I realized that the set up put us all into a circle of sorts. And that was nice, because at least I didn't feel like I was facing a line of people with an invisible wall between us. "I'm Sister Louisa, this is Mother Superior Evangeline, who is the headmistress of this school, and this is Robert Burlington, the head teacher of the senior year."

I placed my hands neatly on my lap and hoped they wouldn't focus on the sweat stains on the maid dress. Or focus on the maid dress.

"Pleased to meet you," I said in what I tried to make my most pleasant voice. "I'm Vera."

The headmistress lowered her glasses down her nose to give me a better look. "I Googled your name." Whatever I thought she'd say, it definitely hadn't been that. "There are a couple of ways it can be interpreted. You could say that it means faith or truth. Faith to Mary, mother of God or the True Mary, the true mother. Very pretty, I like it."

With eyes wide as saucers I said, "Thank you."

I realized right then that I was totally out of my depth. I wasn't religious at all and I was going to have to fake it to get in. Which I was sure was some sort of sin.

I swallowed.

"My mother chose it for me, hoping it'd bring me blessing." I stretched the truth and laid it thick there. All my mother had ever said about my name was that Vera was the name of her grandma on her dad's side, and that she'd always liked it. "We're very devout to the Lord."

A bolt of lightning should have stricken me right there and then.

"That's good," the man spoke then. "You'll be surprised to know that not all of our students are Catholic, but we do hope to convey in them the sense that there is something greater than what they can see and it's a lot easier to educate them when they already believe."



I plastered a smile on my face that made my cheeks hurt. I had to shift the topic somehow before they started asking me if I knew my prayers.

"Ah, I'd like to apologize for being late." I squirmed, really meaning it and hoping that I wasn't shooting myself in the foot by attracting attention to my obvious mistake. "This is not a habit I have, but I didn't realize that my um, workplace, was not as close by as I expected."

The man nodded and the Mother Superior asked, "Workplace?"

Ah, shit. I hoped that wasn't a big no-no.

"Yes, ma'am. I help my ma clean houses sometimes."

They murmured unintelligible words that had me breaking into a sweat.

"That's fine, child," she continued. "But you do know that were you to be admitted into this institution you would have to cease all such activities, correct? While we do value and praise hard work, we want our kids to focus all of that energy into their grades and extra curricular activities."

The younger nun picked right up there. "Our school has a system similar to a college. You live in house during the week to ensure total focus on your education, but during weekends you're free to stay in the dorms or stay at your family's. Even during weekends we recommend that students focus on their personal growth and not on activities that may drive their attention outside of what really matters the most."

In other words, focus on studying and not on earning wages, which I was sure was not a concern any of these kids had. What they didn't know was that ma didn't pay me for helping her out, outside of keeping me fed and with a roof over my head, which this school would provide instead if I were to be accepted. And on weekends I'd just stay here with the excuse that I had too much school work, and I wouldn't have time to clean houses again. I'd thought it through and it was perfect.

I nodded. "I understand."

"Now, Vera," Mr. Burlington said. "You do realize that you intend to join this school in your senior year, and how that can be an immense challenge. Why should we choose you and give you a single year of education, rather than any of the potential freshmen applicants we've had?"

I blanched. This was nowhere near the list of questions Leti and I had prepared for. I prayed hard that some inspiration would beam down on me because all I could come up with was selfish reasons. And inspiration somewhat came to me then, saying that maybe the truth was my best bet. After all, that was the meaning of my name, right?

"To tell you the truth, I wouldn't know." I could tell that this answer puzzled them, so I continued, "I'm certain that it's much better to receive the full benefit of four years of education in this fine school, rather than one, and that yes, surely another kid from a poor family deserves it. But I also know that that doesn't mean I don't deserve it either."

The Mother Superior leaned her elbows down on her knees. "Go on."

I swallowed down the last of my reservations. "What I mean is that, even though you look at it as a single year of education, the way I look at it is an opportunity to completely change my path for the better. Don't I deserve that chance, too?"

I drew in a shaky breath, awaiting their reactions. The Sister Louisa's expression didn't change from when I met her a few minutes ago, frozen into a Mona Lisa smile that betrayed nothing. Too bad she was a nun, otherwise she could make millions off of poker. The Mother Superior looked kind of intrigued and Mr. Burlington nodded in a way that came across as more non committal than it did as an agreement. It was he who made the next question.

"Do you have a special talent that would make you stand out from the other candidates?"

I did a double take. "I'm sorry?"



The Mother Superior waved a hand. "A talent. Something that I probably can't do."

My eyes shifted from one face to the next. "Like... playing the xylophone or something like that?"

Mr. Burlington chuckled. "If that's something you can do, yes."

Sister Louisa explained then, "You see, in our school we don't just focus on the obvious academics. We have strong sports and arts programs as well that attract talent from all across the country. Every student must pursue both academics and talents, which, along with spiritual pursuits, we believe make a well rounded individual."

"Uh..." I trailed off, looking out the window to the thick branches of an old tree outside. What could I do that made me stand out and make them think they absolutely had to choose me? I thought of earlier, when I was singing in a bathroom and berating myself for wasting my time that way instead of preparing for this moment. When all along that had probably been the best prepping I could do.

I shifted my focus back on them and dead sure said, "I can sing."

The man clapped once. "Lovely! Why don't you give us a sample?"

"What?" My jaw unhinged and dropped. Somehow I hadn't expected them to ask for a demonstration.

Sister Louisa smiled wider. "We choose only the best of the best. Are you the best?"

Of course I wasn't. My name wasn't Celine Dion.

Oh my God. Any possible acceptance hung on me singing. It had been so long since I last sang in front of an audience. I could feel my heart racing to catch up with my breath. I was breaking into a sweat, so I rubbed my palms on the skirt of my maid uniform. Any shred of confidence I might have shown earlier seemed to have vanished.

"Um, what would you want me to sing?"

"Surprise us," the Mother Superior said with disinterest. That upped the bar even more.

"Think," I murmured only to myself. What could be a decent song that would showcase my voice, with notes I could hit and that would not offend religious people? I sought for inspiration in my beloved Disney Princesses and as always, they didn't fail me. I looked up with a smile. "I can sing Let it Go from Frozen."

Their eyebrows went up and none of them looked bored or complacent anymore.

Mother Evangeline said, "That's a tough one."

The younger nun nodded. "To be sure."

I was a bit amused that they even knew the song and the movie. It had to be something else to see a bunch of nuns watching animated movies.

"Please go ahead," the man said, motioning with his hand.

I stood up and cleared my throat. It'd always been easier to me to sing while standing up, easier to breathe this way than sitting down. I sent a quick prayer that my pipes wouldn't shut down thanks to my nerves. Then I drew in a deep breath and started with the low tone at the beginning of the song. I tried to imagine that I was Elsa in a castle of my making, and that if the ice couldn't bother me that, surely, the eyes of three strangers couldn't, either. They observed me even as I kept singing and the song escalated all the way to the final, high note that always left me breathless and feeling like I was on top of a mountain.

I gave them an uncertain smile when I was done and realized they hadn't moved a muscle throughout.

I clasped my hands in front of me. "Thank you?"

Sister Louisa stood up. "I believe we are done here."

Panic washed over me. I held her hand as she came over to lead me out. "No, wait. Please! I can show you a different song. Maybe something with more sentiment."

She patted my arm. "That was quite lovely my dear, but you were late and we have an entire day packed with interviews. We'll definitely call you back."

I stood for a second, confused. I thought that would go well, but they didn't seem impressed. I had good grades and somewhat of a talent, but I'd been late and I was applying to take somebody's entire four year education for only one year. My eyes prickled again and I nodded.

"I understand, I'm sorry for being late, again. And thank you for the opportunity."

"We'll call you," was the last thing she said before she shut the door between us. Which felt metaphoric as hell, if you asked me.

I realized that there were a couple of kids sitting outside waiting and that that was it. That had been my chance and I'd blown it.

"Good luck."

They looked up from their phones as I said this, and as I left the school I realized that I'd meant it. Even if this meant I had to find another way to leave everything behind, I would.

I was like a weed. Ugly, but I never gave up.

Oops! This image does not follow our content guidelines. To continue publishing, please remove it or upload a different image. hey'all! i think i can foresee a few questions coming up in future, so let's have a brief FAQ:

Question 1: What's up with the weird chapter titles?

answer: this is how i get my jollies, ok? i had such fun making the puns!

Question 2: Okay fine, but why those songs? Nobody knows them!

answer: yeah but i do, and like i said i wrote this whole story to appease my inner music snob. so all of these songs are music that has been with me throughout the years, through thick and thin. quite a few of the songs served as inspiration for the story, too.

Question 3: But what about the music I like?

answer: sorry, but i don't know who you are! for all i know you're a 12 year old girl, a 43 year old woman or a 28 year old man. besides, this story is specifically about ROCK, so to me it doesn't make sense if i start using Taylor Swift song titles, to give you an example.

i hope that clears a few things up for the curious minds 😉

♪ Bring Me To Fight ♪



The mailman put a yellow envelop in our mailbox exactly a week after that, that contained the results from the Holy Trinity High School interview.

Of course, I didn't even think to check the mail as I left the gringo's house that day and walked over to my best friend Leti's across the street. I walked into the living room from the front door and gave her Nana a kiss on the cheek. Nana was so old that no one knew exactly what her age was. Even though she had trouble making her way around by herself, she was the sweetest person I'd ever met in my 17 years of life and she never failed to make me feel like I was her own great granddaughter.

"Bendición?" I asked her, the traditional way to greet an elder that was never in use in my house.

"Dios te bendiga," she told me in a trembling and raspy voice.

Nana's daughter was Leti's grandma. She barreled out of the kitchen to see who it was. Contrary to Nana, Grammie Socorro didn't like me that much, as seen by the sudden downturn of her mouth. "Oh, it's you." I repeated my greeting to her and she spat out the blessing sorely by the sheer power of politeness, but I could tell it tasted sour on her tongue. "Leti's in her room, getting ready for who knows which party this time, bleh."

I racked my brain trying to remember which party there was tonight but came out blank. Socorro gave me one more nasty look before going back into the kitchen, as though I was the reason why her granddaughter spent most of her time party-hopping, when in reality I barely went to a third of the parties. I liked to dance only a bit less than I liked singing because, hey, Latina al fin . When the rhythm found me, it found me. But I wasn't a huge fan of the local party scene. One thing was a wedding or a quinceañera, but a teenage party was filled with many more hormones than I knew what to do with. And it hadn't gone well for me in the past.

Latina al fin Nana's chuckle brought my focus back to her. She squeezed my hand. "Cuídame a Leti, sí?"

"I'll try," I said, seeing as she focused on the TV again.

Leti's parents were probably at work at this time, so I didn't find anybody else in the house until I reached my best friend's room and found her in the middle of her version of getting ready. Half dressed and half made up but fully dancing to Jerry Rivera in the middle of her room. I ignored all of this by virtue of having seen it so much already, and flopped on her bed.

"What's the party this time?" I asked her as I hugged her pillow.

She whirled around and clasped her hands in front of her. "You're kidding, right? It's only the best party before the start of the school year. No one's going to remember any other party we had this summer, except for this one. It's-"

I raised my palm up to silence her. "Let me guess, it's DeAndre's party."

She squealed and bounced on her heels. Okay, so DeAndre was the hottest guy, not just in our class, but in the whole school. He'd even been recruited to do modeling. I'd even seen rich white ladies double take at him. I'd be lying if I said that I was immune to him, because I certainly wasn't, but my favorite part about him was that he was like, a genuinely nice guy. He didn't do any of those boasting macho shenanigans that were so common in these parts and got a lot of boys in trouble. No, DeAndre was clean and did well in school.



And besides, despite his god-like status, he treated me well. Like I mattered, too. So I developed a bit of a crush on him since sophomore year. No one knew about this, especially not Leti, whose crush on him was legendary.

"Well, have fun."

Her head did this thing where it pulled back a little just as her expression morphed into a perfect Latina resting bitch face. "That almost sounds as if you're not coming."

"Five points for Gryffindor," I said.

Leti rolled her eyes at me. "Don't tell me you're still moping about that interview, chica."

"I'm not." At her look I deflated. "Fine, I am. I can't believe I botched that up so badly."

She turned to her mirror and gasped as she realized that she hadn't even finished her contouring. As she set out to do just that, she spared me no slack as she said, "Frankly I can't believe it either. You're the responsible out of the two of us, and you really wanted that."

"Gee, thanks." I hugged her pillow harder.

She glanced at me through her mirror as she evened out the different colors on her face. She'd learned everything she knew from Youtube, but I couldn't be convinced that a pro makeup artist could possibly be better than her. Leti was a pretty girl, but after she was done she was stunning.

"Things happen for a reason. Maybe we're supposed to be together during our senior year, after all." She sucked her cheeks like a fish so she could blend the sides of her face. When she was satisfied with the look, she continued, "I mean, do you really think it'd be a walk in the park to be surrounded with stupid rich kids who have no clue how hard life really is?"

I rolled my eyes. "I didn't apply for that. I don't care about the rich kids, but I'd really like to become one, by myself."

"And Trinity is going to get you there?" She turned to me with a tilt to her head.

Now irritated for sure, I threw her pillow away and got up from her bed. "Maybe not, but it'll definitely give me more tools to get there than staying in the barrio."

Oh, I knew I'd done it. Her entire face flared in fury and even the thick makeup couldn't hide her angry flush. We'd had this discussion since the moment I told her I wanted to apply to Trinity, and I kinda got it. We'd spent our entire lives spitting curses at that school and all the people associated with it for thinking they were so much better than us. It was easy to think that you were better when you were born ahead by a merit not your own.

"Do you not get it or do you refuse to get it?" I didn't want to bother Nana or bring Grammie Socorro running over, so I didn't yell like I'd have loved to. "What I think about the Trinity kids hasn't changed and it also doesn't matter, because if I can take advantage of their privilege I will. But I guess that doesn't matter now, and instead of making me feel better you're just picking a fight."

Leti sniffed. "Okay, I love you and I support you. It's just that sometimes I wish you were prouder of who you are instead of trying to become who you're not."

Her phone pinged then, and I was glad for it because I felt hot all over and my eyes were prickling again. I'd already done too much crying over this entire fiasco for the entire past week, and I just wanted to forget about the whole thing. Leti was probably right. I didn't know what I'd got in my head, thinking that somehow I could better myself around a bunch of people whose interest was to step on me to raise themselves. Going to Trinity wasn't going to get rid of everything I didn't like that made me me . It was probably only going to make it stick out like a sore thumb instead.

me Maybe I'd screwed up, yes, but maybe one last year with Leti, parties in the barrio and then heading out to a nice community college wouldn't be so bad.



She finished texting and I didn't even have to ask who had been on the other side because it was written all over her face. "DeAndre's actually going to come pick me up on his way back from the liquor store. So as I finish my makeup, please do us the favor of finding something nicer in my closet for you to wear than that t-shirt and mom jeans."

I folded my arms. "Now I know you're just being rude. You know your clothes don't fit me."

"I have some cool stuff from our chubby days that you can try."

Our chubby days had been three years ago and I doubted any of that was in fashion anymore. We'd both decided to go on an intense diet and Leti had emerged drop dead gorgeous and curvaceous. Meanwhile I'd emerged one size bigger.

"No, thanks. Besides, I'm not going."

She stopped in the mid of eye lining. "Don't make me force you."

"Please, as if you could," as I said this I grinned and saluted. "Don't do anything I wouldn't do, adiós!"

Then I ran out the door, giggling as she shrieked. I knew she wouldn't follow me because precious seconds were ticking between getting ready and seeing her crush, and while I could appreciate that she wanted me to have fun too, it was just too bad that our ideas of what fun was had drifted apart a while ago. I said goodbye to the older ladies as I left out the front door and almost smacked right into DeAndre's chest.

"Whoa," he said, all deep and manly. I realized a beat later that his hands held me steady by my arms. "You okay, V?"

I looked up and only saw a mass of my hair, so I pushed it away and his perfect smile was revealed to me. To my utter horror I sighed aloud. And then I stammered.

"Uh, um, hi."

His eyes twinkled. "You should be thanking me. If I hadn't been in the right spot your face would have met the floor intimately."

It was about to do that even though he was still holding me. I stepped back with as much grace as I could manage. "Thanks, but to be honest I wouldn't have stumbled at all if you hadn't suddenly appeared in front of me."

He laughed, not at all bothered by the fact that my temper chose the worse possible moments to come out. I wished I'd said something cute like he was my savior or something, anything that made me seem more like a sweet girl.

I had two modes only, shy and angry. Shy when faced with someone else. Angry at myself. There didn't seem to be any in betweens.

"You're probably right," he said, easily putting my hackles to rest. "By the way, are you coming to my party?"

I patted my hair firmly out of the way and looked down at my shoes. They were white back in the day and were now full of scribbles and drawings and stains of who knew what.

"I don't think so, no."

"Aw, why? It'll be so much fun." For other people, I thought. He gave me another smile of the kind that got him a modeling contract signed. "I was hoping you could even sing, like in the old days."

The old days, when I thought I could attract attention for my singing talent instead of my frame. Before I realized that nobody really saw past the latter.

"Sorry, I don't do that anymore." Then I shifted topic, because I'd had enough of feeling inadequate at least for today. "Anyway, Leti's not ready yet so you'll have to keep Nana some company."

"I can do that," he said with a nod.

"And DeAndre?" I debated whether to say this, but I decided that it was okay. If Leti got pissed at me later, so be it. We fought as much as we had fun together, anyway. "Could you please just ask Leti out once and for all? You've been making her wait for too long."

His dark eyes were wide as saucers. "I, uh." I gave him my own version of the resting bitch face, which usually didn't carry a lot of power but worked this time. "Okay, I will."

I saluted and left. My job was done here.

I returned home, ready to face another night of the gringo getting drunk and ma fussing about baby Victor, but instead I walked into silence. I found ma and her husband sitting together in the kitchen, reading from a paper. They looked up as I walked in.

"Vera Maria," my ma said, and I knew by the tone and the use of my two names that I was in deep shit. My mind scrambled to find the possible cause, but the truth was that I was a goodie two shoes. I couldn't think of a single reason. "We need to talk."

"Okay." I sat in front of them. I had a feeling, fed maybe by the sombre looks on their faces, or by the peculiar charge in the air, that something had changed and it had something to do with me. And that whatever it was, they didn't like it. "What's going on?"

Ma looked down at the paper. "You have a letter here from Holy Trinity High School." I broke into a sweat in the course of a single second. I didn't even know such a feat was possible. "It says that you've been accepted to the program."

♪ Welcome To The Boarding School ♪ They decided to let me change to Trinity.

They decided .

They decided As if they were the ones giving me the opportunity. Or as if they were not going to save a ton of money thanks to it.

Ma's real concern had been about what she'd do when she was short of a girl for a job, but she perked right up when she read the part in the letter that said I was free to go home on weekends. The gringo remained silent throughout the whole thing, but I could tell he was pleased with the life twist. With me gone they were free to pretend they were a real, wholesome family. Except for the drinking problem, but at that moment I didn't give a shit about those details.

Because I was in! Starting September I'd be wearing the school uniform of an elite school that for sure was going to get me admitted to a good university on the opposite coast of the country. A dream come true.

Leti was mad at me. I didn't know if it was because she found out I asked DeAndre to ask her out or if it was because she was still feeling betrayed that I thought Trinity was a better school and that I was ditching her for it. And I did think it was a way better school, she just refused to understand I didn't think its kids were better than us. But that was her problem and not mine, and this was my time to shine.

My ma helped me pack on the Saturday of Labor Day weekend. Sunday was my official move-in date into the dorms. According to the package they sent along with the acceptance letter, new students had to arrive at least two days before class start for a few mandatory orientation activities. Returning students had just to arrive the day before.

I felt like I was going to freaking Hogwarts.

It didn't help that the school looked all classic and sober on the outside. It was like someone had dumped a British castle in the middle of Central Florida, but it didn't look out of place in the area surrounded by $5 million dollar houses. As ma drove me over to the school on Sunday, I had to refrain myself from squealing every 30 seconds and also from waving goodbye at the fancy houses I hoped to stop cleaning pretty soon. I was so gonna stick to my plan of not leaving the school on weekends. Visiting the barrio wouldn't at all be like going on a field trip to Hogsmeade.

There was a short line of cars entering the school. Each one was being checked by a guard. When I squinted I could see it was the same guy who led me into the school for my interview a few weeks ago. He leaned down to ma's window level when it was our turn and recognized me right away.

"You made it!" He looked delighted. Like I wished my own mother did. "Welcome to Holy Trinity High School, I'm glad they let you in, kiddo."

I beamed. "Thank you."

He still checked our info before letting us in, which didn't amuse my ma.

"If he already knew you, why did he have to check all our papers like he was working for la migra?" she asked.



I shrugged. "Probably because they care about keeping rich kids safe, I don't know."

Our car was the most rundown in the entire parking lot. The old little Corolla couldn't hold a candle to any of the cars with brands so expensive that I had trouble pronouncing. My tongue always got twisted on all the Italian cars, and was it JAGuar or JaGUAR?

We got out of the car and debated whether to bring my one suitcase in with us, or if to wait. We went for the latter, and that was a good thing. As soon as we stepped into the building we were ushered into a large room along with the rest of the parents and new kids. I counted about thirty kids for what I assumed was mostly the freshman class and maybe a handful of new students for the other school years. Class sizes were small, which helped the impression of exclusivity.

I recognized the Mother Superior and the younger nun from my interview when they stepped into the room along with a group of other people. Teachers, I assumed. Mr. Burlington wasn't among them, and with a startle I realized that he was now going to be my head teacher.

How crazy was this?

They welcomed us into the school and explained the rules and guidelines. Everything from how the time table of classes worked, to curfews and the mandatory "romantic relationships between students are strongly discouraged and sexual relations are strictly forbidden."

Ma and I snorted at the same time. We also pretended that we'd done nothing and were in complete agreement when the sound attracted a few looks.

When we walked out of the room she patted my hand. "I'm glad I don't have to worry about you getting involved with a boy."

I looked at her, pretending to be confused even though I totally knew what she meant. "What do you mean?" I asked.

She shrugged. "Well, that kinda thing is for different girls, you know? Girls who are really into boys."

And whom boys are into, she meant. Surely no boy would ever want to get me undressed.

In a clipped tone I said, "Right."

Sister Louisa found us then, and she had the same enigmatic smile as she did during my interview. "Welcome home, Vera. We're so glad you decided to join us."

I was absolutely intrigued by her choice of words. Home? That I decided to join them?

I looked all around me at the checkered marble floor, the wood paneled walls that didn't seem to end, stained glass windows and religious art sculptures that flanked a sprawling staircase. This was so far from what I'd known as home that it was mind-blowing to think we were only a few miles away. And yet it already felt like I belonged here much more. Because it was the first place where someone accepted me for being me, rather than putting up with me simply because they had to.

But it wasn't like the decision to be here was completely mine. I knocked on the figurative door, they opened it and my ma didn't trip me on the way in. That was pretty damn different.

Still, I smiled back at her. "I'm so happy to be here, thank you."

She nodded and introduced herself to my mother. Then she said, "Please follow me and I will take you to your room. I believe your roommate is already settled in."

"Is she also a scholarship student?" Because that'd be great. An ally.

"No, just an early arrival."

Oh.

We followed her up the staircase and she explained the general layout of the school. The upper levels of the left wing were exclusively the girls dorms, for all the school years. The boys' was the entire right wing. Everything in between was the main classrooms and laboratories. Unlike a typical American high school, each class per school year had an assigned classroom and it was the teachers whom rotated. This entire system helped the teachers make sure that kids were not escaping and hiding around.



"The nuns," she said, "live on the ground floor of the right wing. If you ever come into trouble or need help, you're free to come to us at any time of the day or night. We're also here for counseling."

She explained that there were usually 12 girls and 12 boys per class and so the identifiers for rooms started by 1 for freshmen and 4 for seniors. So for example, since there were two girls per room, we had six rooms per school year. She turned to us. "You'll be in room 43 of the left wing. There's a 43 in the right wing as well, for two boys."

I noticed then that where she'd stopped was right outside room 43. We were in a long hallway on the third floor where, on one side, the rows of doors started by 3 and the other row by 4.

Sister Louisa knocked on the door and we heard faint steps.

A huge girl opened the door. And by huge I meant she was so tall that both my ma and I had to crane our heads back to meet her eyes. Her eyebrows went up.

"Hello," she said in a way that came across as tentative to me. Like we were possibly any intimidating.

"Hi, Addy," Sister Louisa said. "This here is Vera de la Cruz, your new roommate and classmate, and her mother."

The girl's cheeks colored just the slightest bit. "Oh, hi. I'm Adele Holt, nice to meet you."

We shook hands. Hers dwarfed mine, but her grip was soft. Shy. Like me.

I liked her immediately.

"Very well," Sister Louisa said as she turned to my ma. "Would you like to come with me so that we can speak more about the school?"

Ma gave me her stink eye that meant I better behave, or else a chancla was flying my way. "That's fine. I have to bring up her suitcase anyway."

I watched them walk away with a lot more glee than I cared to admit. I was sure most kids would be sad to be parting ways from their mom, but boy, was I doing us both a favor.

I felt free.

"Um." My roommate's voice pulled me out of my head. "I heard you're a scholarship student."

I opened and closed my mouth, thinking of all the possible reasons why she'd bring this up right away. And most of them were not that friendly. "I, uh. Yes, I am. Is that bad?"

She gasped. "No, not at all! I'm glad you are. I was pretty sick of being stuck with a snob in my room for the past three years." She waved one hand as if dismissing a thought. "I mean, don't get me wrong. I'm technically a snob too, because my parents can actually afford this place, but I make it a point to not be a total douchebag and that hasn't exactly gained me popularity around here. I'm just saying that if you're looking forward to joining the exclusive social circles of this place, you and I shouldn't hang out much."

My dimples were probably showing as I smiled up, way up at her. "You know what? I don't give a shit about what the rich kids think and I like you already. How about we tell them to fuck off and we become friends instead?"

I could tell this had floored her because there didn't seem to be anything in the world that she could hide with how open her expression was.

"Okay, cool." Her obvious delight faltered. "But don't say I didn't warn you. The kids here are brutal, and the richer and prettier they are, the worse they get."

I gave her a salute. "I'll keep that in mind."

Puh-lease, I was from the barrio. How bad did these kids think they could be?

My ma wasn't entirely pleased with how everything had developed, my best friend was mad at me and this probably made me a terrible person, but I was completely over the moon. I made something happen for me. Something good. Everyone who had asked me why even try, that I most likely wouldn't get in, could suck it.

I actually felt like singing Unwritten by Natasha Bedingfield. That was how cheesy happy I felt.

Ma came back with my suitcase and new uniforms and found me in the middle of a deep get-to-know-each-other session with my new roommate — and oh my God, I now had a roommate, how adult did that sound?

"I can see that you're busy." Undeterred by my desire to ignore her, she went on, "But we need to talk before I leave."

Addy shot up to her feet. "Oh, that's okay. I can leave."

"No, I'll walk ma out." We left the room and she grabbed my arms in a vice once we were outside, getting all up in my grill. "Whoa, you're scaring me."

"Listen to me chiquita." Her eyes narrowed. Was she mad? "This whole thing is crazy and I probably shouldn't even be allowing it. The only reason I am is because you're going to be under the care of good, religious people. So you better behave and not do something crazy like, like-"

I supplied helpfully. "Get pregnant?"

Her fingers tightened on my flesh and I was sure I was going to bruise.

"That or something else that would make this people think that we're low class."

"Right."

And by that I meant, thanks for the encouragement, ma. I know you're proud of me for getting here. I'll work hard.

"And if this doesn't go well," she said as a final warning. "I'm pulling you out of this place. Entendiste?"

I nodded. "Crystal clear."

Except that wasn't going to happen, because I was going to ace every freaking test even if it meant not sleeping or eating until I caught up to the level of this school. I was not going to waste this miracle.

That thought helped me wave her away with a smile. Once she made her way down the stairs I felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. It wasn't her I had to impress anymore. When it came down to it, now it was only myself I had to surpass.

I twirled around and went back into room 43. I found Addy holding up my brand new skirt. It was made in that fancy navy and burgundy plaid that was probably worth every piece of clothes I had back home. There was a spare, a few short sleeved white shirts and a couple long sleeved ones, a tie, two blazers and a big box. Once I opened it I found one pair of sleek brown shoes and many pairs of socks. And my first thought was that I hoped the shoes were wide.



"I think they gave you a size too big," she said, inspecting my skirt.

"Why? What makes you think that?"

She lifted her eyebrows. "I have an eye. Try it on."

She didn't have to ask twice. I wanted to see how I looked like in a private school uniform anyway. I grabbed it and one of the shirts and took a look around. Two beds with drawers under them. A large desk that I supposed we had to share, backed against a window. A lot of shelving. One single door.

"Where's the bathroom?" I asked, hoping that there was an attic door that led to it or something.

"It's a shared bathroom for the entire floor."

I died.

Okay, I didn't. But it sure felt like the life was leaving my corporeal shell.

"No." I exhaled the word like it was my last breath.

Addy gave me a solemn nod. "I'm not gonna sugar coat it. It sucks and girls are mean. If you ignore them they usually get tired of teasing you pretty quick, though."

My good mood started to sour.

I changed in the room as she turned her back on me and went back to browsing on her laptop. Over the top of her shoulder I saw that she was looking at clothes. Pretty high end stuff, actually. When I was done I announced that and she turned to face me. There was a mirror hanging behind the door and we both stood in front of it.

Yeah, it was kinda large and boxy. I decided to take that as a flattering thing, because it wasn't often that clothes fit too big on me. Although most likely the school people had probably just thought I was fatter than I already was.

She grabbed the waist of the skirt and cinched. "Hmm, I could pull it in just a couple of fingers, roll the hem up a little as well. You look more nunnish than the nuns themselves."

"You can do that?"

"I have two talents. One is smacking my big head into low door frames and the other one is making clothes." She laughed at the amazement that undoubtedly oozed from me. "Just leave me to it and go explore. You need to be able to find your way around."

I gaped for a second longer. "You'd really do that for me?"

"Free of charge even."

"Careful," I said with a grin. "You're going to make me thing that not everybody here is that bad."

She shrugged one shoulder. "Nah, I'm just special. They still suck."

After assurances that she really wanted to do this I decided her advice was solid. I picked up my introductory packet and set out to explore every nook and cranny. This building was by far the biggest in campus. Just the wing with the girls dorms was massive. On the map it showed two entrances leading to it. One from the middle of the building, the most convenient one to go to and from class, and one at the very far end that led to service stairs. In case of a fire, I guessed. In any case, both entrances were blocked by a door for which I needed to use a key fob. I supposed it was a pretty high tech way to keep the boys out.

I found my classroom on the third floor as well, and discovered that there were actually three different groups in my school year. We shared floor with the juniors classrooms as well. Freshmen and sophomore were in the second floor.

I made it all the way down to the first floor. Most of it was the cafeteria. My jaw dropped not at how spacious it was, but at the fact that it was fully stocked and it didn't seem like I had to pay for anything. Once I made sure there were no barcodes or dollar values anywhere, I swiped a deli sandwich and a Dr. Pepper. The cafeteria oversaw the grounds of the school and it was just...



"Damn," I said aloud. "Rich people really do live another life."

The school had its own little lake. Old trees with rich foliage. Freaking swans frolicking about.

I shook my head to myself and looked back down at the map. The other two buildings surrounded the lake as well. To the right, what seemed to be a fairly big one, was the library and the accommodations for the rest of the teachers. The building on the left was bigger, it had the indoors pool and basketball court. A baseball and a football field were beyond the lake.

Birds were chirping once I came outside. It was ridiculous. The only acceptable reaction to that was to twirl with my arms spread open like I was Aurora in the forest, just before prince Philip shows up and joins her in a duet. Except no prince appeared and my sandwich went flying under a tree. I ran after it but it was wrapped so tightly that no harm was done, so I sat under the shade and unwrapped it. I took a bite and basked in my accomplishment.

I got into Holy Trinity High School.

This deserved a toast. I reached for the Dr. Pepper and twisted the cap. I'd shaken the thing so much that a spray of gassy liquid showered over my hand.

"Shit!"

I was answered by the sound of a guitar.

I froze and waited. Was I going crazy?

As nothing else happened for a bit, I set out to wipe my arm with my jeans. They were dark enough that it wouldn't show. I took another bite of the sandwich and the music started again. This time I was sure I wasn't crazy enough. It wasn't like my imagination could conjure that stupid song that played in every graduation out of thin air.

Food and drink in hand, I stood up and walked into the little forest, following the music. A guy's voice joined it into the first lines and I stopped. I thought about it for a hot second. I was better off just backing away and never knowing who it was, because frankly, learning who was behind the excellent playing and nice voice was not going to change my life. I might even spare myself some embarrassment.

But let the record show that I was an excellent student at school and a complete idiot at everything else.

And so I kept walking, even though I was half soaked in soda and munching on a sandwich. Which, in retrospective, was definitely not my best look.

Instead I came face to face with the hottest guy I'd ever seen in the flesh.

Again.

He looked up from his guitar and I was stricken by the blue eyes. Some Caribbean ocean type of hue. Same auburn hair, combed messily at the top of his head. Same chiseled jaw. Straight nose. Perfect lips.

Ay, Dios mío.

He took in my sorry state and his eyebrows furrowed a bit. "Who are you?"

And just like that, it was as if a bucket full of cold water was dumped on me.

I turned my chin up, exactly the same way my ma did when people ask her things like, and do you clean for a living? That's all you do?

Because, yeah, most rich people didn't care about us. We were supposed to do our thing, unseen. Just like the dirt and mess we cleaned was also supposed to be unseen. Same level. I really hated those people. And at the same time I was embarrassed that yeah, that was what my ma and I did. We made a living out of something most people didn't want to do.

It didn't make it right to be treated like this.

A weird mix of hurt and pride surged through me. I looked him dead in the eyes and said, "Of course not. I'm invisible."

I walked away with a huff. The music didn't start again until I reached the building.

♪ Mystery Business ♪ Addy and I grabbed breakfast together the morning before our first class. We sat on one of the tables close to the buffet line, where nobody cool would ever be caught dead. I checked my phone, searching for a text from Leti that never came. I refused to let her tantrum ruin my day, though, so I put the phone away in my backpack.

"See that table over there?" She pointed casually to the middle of the cafeteria as she sipped on an orange juice carton that looked too small for her. "The one right under the third chandelier. Those are the queen bees of our school year."

The five girls looked like copies of each other. Same luscious hair in different colors, but same styles and definitely the same surgeons.

I saluted. "Roger that, avoid at all costs."

"It's like total cliche." She sucked the last few drops of juice, loud enough to attract the attention of a few people around, and grabbed a second carton. "The blonde one is the ring leader and this whole school bows down to her."

I looked at my roommate with a shrewd eye. "Do you also bow down to her?"

She flashed me a grin. "I pretend to."

Good tip, probably. I pulled out a notebook. I had to write all this shit down. "Okay, what's her name?"

"You're seriously gonna make notes?" She laughed. "Okay, fine. Her name is Madison Hollingsworth. She goes by Madison and will destroy you if you call her Maddy."

I sniffed. "Her name sounds expensive."

"She is."

Then she listed the names of the other girls. There was a Georgette, a Clara, a Natasha and a Belle. Isabelle. Whatever. I could just see the horror on their perfect faces once they heard I was called something as mundane as Vera Maria de la Cruz Vazquez. Get a load of that!

Addy grew too excited to contain it. "Oh, check that out. See the guy walking in with the letter jacket?" I did. He gave DeAndre a run for his money. All black and unapologetically delicious. He was actually the first guy of color I'd seen around. "That's Quinn Montgomery. He's the ace of the baseball team and up until last year was the best friend of the hottest guy in campus."

My eyebrows went up as I followed his trek to the buffet line. "You mean there's a hotter guy than him?"

But then the stupid idiot with his guitar came to mind and, yeah. That guy was made of the same things as lightning, cotton candy and sex. And I wasn't even into white boys.

Addy's grin reached all the way to her honey, almost yellow eyes. I followed where they stared at and saw him.

Again.

I pursed my lips, half expecting a spotlight to appear on him. And although that didn't happen, people did clear a path for him as he walked toward the queue. He stopped behind whoever the Quinn guy was and it was like he'd noticed the other boy for the first time. They both stared at each other and the air grew so thick with tension that even I had trouble drawing in a breath.



"What the fuck is going on?" I asked my new friend in a whisper.

"That, is high school drama." She sipped from her juice and pointed at my notebook. "You may wanna write this down. The new guy? That's Ashton Winters. King of the world. Until he was dethroned, that is."

"By..." I trailed off as I pointed at the other guy with my pen. She nodded. "And they were best friends, you said?"

What a shitshow. And here I thought barrio-type of problems wouldn't reach me here.

"Oh, it was incredible. You should've seen it." I could tell she was holding back her laughter by the way her eyes shone and crinkled at the corners. "Madison dumped Ashton in front of the entire school after a baseball game last year, turned and smacked her lips right into Quinn's. So the queen bee chose her new king and the old king became an outcast."

I jotted all this down even as I laughed. I made some funny doodles to go with their names and drew lines leading from one to the other into a big ass triangle. I looked back up at them as they moved in the line. Enough girls looked at the Ashton guy with adoring eyes to make me think he wasn't exactly what I'd define as an outcast. Once I said this aloud Addy just shrugged.

"Well, he doesn't hang out with any of his old crew anymore. Maybe it's just a self imposed exile." She finished her last juice and then added, "Although that might also have something to do with all the drama that went down with his brother, too."

I was about to ask what that had been about when the first guy grabbed his tray and walked over to join all the jock looking dudes sitting on the table next to the five clones. Pretty boy Ashton looked at them, tray in hand, in a way that almost made me pity him. Then he made eye contact with me, for some reason, and I looked down at my notes. I made a big X next to his name and jotted down avoid, avoid, avoid .

avoid, avoid, avoid Addy sighed. "I bet you there's gonna be a fist fight between them this year."

After a while the bell rang and we walked together to our classroom, 4-1. We found some good seats by the window. I sat on the previous to last desk, because the very last one already had someone's books on it. Addy turned around in front of me and we kept chatting as the rest of the kids trickled into the room. My eyes, traitorous that they were, latched onto Ashton Winters as soon as he walked in. I hated that he had the same effect on me as on any other girl, even though I knew he was a stupid snob. And just why did he have to be in the same class as me?

It didn't matter though, because he was not going to distract me from getting perfect grades.

Except that he sat on the desk behind me.

Addy glanced at me over her shoulder and wiggled her eyebrows. I widened my eyes in that universal way that meant, shut up or else .

shut up or else To no one's surprise the school queen and king were also in our class. I wondered if there was popcorn in the cafeteria. I had a feeling I was gonna need it.

Mr. Burlington came in last and shut the door.

He beamed at us. "Welcome, senior class. This is going to be your last year and we better make it count." No one made a single noise. I kinda wanted to clap, though. Today was a celebration for me. He stood in front of the class and clasped his hands in front of himself, taking a moment to look at some faces. "I have no doubt in this class. You are without a shred of doubt some of the most talented students we've had in the history of this school, be it at sports," he said, motioning toward Quinn, some other guys and a girl. Then he continued, "The performing or visual arts." At the last one he pointed at Addy, and she sat up straighter. Then I felt his eyes on me. "Or music."

There was a murmur. I looked around and saw that the eyes were not on me, but on the guy behind me. I relaxed. He did play guitar, after all.

"Vera, why don't you stand up?" the teacher asked, and my stomach plummeted to the floor.

"What?"

My reflexive question raised some giggles. I scrambled to stand up, dreading where this was going.

"Everybody, this is Vera Maria de la Cruz Vazquez." Oh my God, he used my entire stinking name. And with a decent Spanish accent, to boot. Now every freaking eye was on me. "She is a scholarship student that won us over with her voice."

This time I managed to swallow back another, what?

what? It was my singing what got me in?

His eyes slight up at my WTF expression. "She'll be joining our music department and making our orchestra shine in this year's competitions. Everybody, please, let's welcome her with an applause."

My jaw positively touched the floor.

The applause, that could be described as wane at best, stopped once a hand went up in the middle of the room. I traced it back to the blonde queen bee. She turned back to me and gave me a smile that probably won her beauty pageants on the regular. "As the lead violinist I would like to make sure we only get the best of the best. Why don't you give us a demonstration?"

I stammered and this only seemed to fuel the malice behind her smile.

"Aw, are you shy?" She cooed and then turned back to Mr. Burlington. "How is a shy little mouse like her take us all the way to nationals?"

One of her cronies giggled. "Not so little, actually."

My face burned and I plopped down on my seat before I was told to.

Mr. Burlington ignored the last comment. "With a little help and polish from her fellow musicians, I'm sure she will shine." He looked my way again and I lowered my eyes to the desk out of instinct. "Vera, I don't suppose you have any music training, so we should probably teach you the basics. Ashton?"

I got whiplash looking up so fast.

The boy behind me hummed a question in his deep voice.

"Why don't you teach her the basics after class?" the teacher asked him. "I'm sure you can put her up to speed in no time."

I sat. Frozen. Looking at Mr. Burlington like he was insane. And he was. I didn't sign up to this school for music competitions. I signed up for a perfect GPA. A great school in my curriculum for college applications. I signed up to be accepted to a good college in California or Oregon. Alaska, even. Somewhere far.

I wasn't breathing anymore.

"Sure," his voice came from behind me. Uninterested. Aloof.

As Mr. Burlington begun his history lesson, I kept screaming in my head that this was not what I wanted. I'd stopped singing. I only did it during the interview because I was desperate. But it had made me stand out then. And even though I hadn't opened my mouth, it was making me stand out now. I felt eyes behind me and all around me and I sank into my chair.

This was not going the way I wanted.

"Is there any alcohol in here?" I asked Addy as we had lunch on the same table. "I think I'm going to need it."

She flipped the pages of Vogue with one hand and held a pizza slice with the other. Without looking up she said, "You'll be fine. Ashton will give you one lesson to get the teachers off his back and then go off to do whatever his thing is. Girls, I guess."

"I don't care about that." But I lied. I did care. I just didn't care to share that the reason I was dreading him was because he forgot about me cleaning his bathroom. "I didn't sign up to this school to... sing. That wasn't even on my admission letter."

him Her eyes drifted to mine for a second. "Seems to me like that's what they admitted you for, though." She took a large bite of food and, with her mouth full, said, "You must be something else for that kind of praise from Mr. Burlington. Did you know that our school has won awards for small chamber pieces before?"

My eyes were wide as saucers. "I don't even know what that is."

And this. This was the thing that distracted me. I spent the rest of the afternoon surreptitiously looking at my phone, googling things like what is a chamber piece, what is an orchestra, what does a singer do in an orchestra. And the answer to the last question was terrifying. If Google were a smartass it'd have replied they sing, duh, but instead a bunch of opera singers came as result. I was hyperventilating by the time the last lesson was done. And I hadn't made good notes on the lessons.

I jumped at Addy and held her by the arm. "Help."

She patted the top of my head. "You're gonna be fine."

I gaped as she left. Our friendship was still new but I felt betrayed.

Someone cleared their throat and I turned to find the perfect guy standing there with his guitar case. I pursed my lips. It was becoming a reflex every time I saw him.

"So, Vera," he said, running a hand through his annoyingly silky hair. It wasn't right that his hair was that smooth and shiny and mine was the next best thing to barbed wire. "I'm Ashton, you can call me Ash. Or Ashton. Whichever's fine."

I was going to call him never , that was for sure.

never Even though I didn't like him, I was still trained by my ma's chancla to be polite. "Nice to meet you, I guess." But I couldn't help adding that last little passive-aggressive tag there. I avoided looking at his face because it made me nervous, so instead I zeroed in on his guitar. "So, um. What is it that we're doing?"

He waited until the last few people left the room until he replied. "To be honest, I don't know yet. I don't know where you're at."

I shrugged. "I can't read music or play fancy instruments or sing in other languages." A true smile escaped me. "Aside from Spanish. But I don't really think Miss Prissy would like to play the violin for a Selena song."



His lips slowly stretched into a smirk that lit his blue eyes up in amusement. "I'd pay to see that."

I cleared my throat and looked around me. I picked up my backpack because that was better than focusing on how that little smile made me feel. Like I was watching porn. I tried to remember that this was a Catholic school and that worshipping a boy was probably a pagan thing, and that I shouldn't go down that path.

"Okay," he said, sparing me from my thoughts. "Let's head out to the music room."

I looked up again. "There's a music room? I didn't see it in the map."

"Just follow me."

He turned around and I looked at his broad back with a strange feeling. It was clawing at my throat, and I couldn't explain it.

But I did. I followed him and I experienced secondhand what it was like to have people step out of your way in admiration. I was completely puzzled by how a single person could command a reaction like this. I didn't think even a celebrity did. Didn't they tend to draw people in instead?

I'd only seen people get the hell out of someone's path when they were bad. We had a few rotten apples in my barrio that had this effect. But the looks this boy got from students and faculty members alike was nothing like that. They didn't move away because he smelled rotten. It seemed like people didn't think they deserve to share the same space.

"Wow," I muttered under my breath.

He looked at me over his shoulder. "What?"

I opened my mouth. Closed it. There was no point in me drawing attention to something that was probably obvious to him. Maybe even uncomfortable. I could see how someone like him could also get isolated by their own reputation.

"Nothing."

It turned out the music room, or auditorium, more like, was also in the same building as the library.

I pulled out my map and read this portion of it in more detail. Graphic and visual arts were also there, so if everything went to shit and I ended up running out of the music room in tears of humiliation I might be able to find Addy.

He walked into the room with the ease of someone who has treaded the same path over and over. Uncaring by his surroundings. Confident.

This room was terrifying to me.

So, okay. The earliest I remembered singing in front of strangers was when I was six at some other kid's birthday party. I was sure I sounded like a chipmunk, but all the adults in the room had praised me. I still remembered feeling fuller from that than from all the candy and cake I'd eaten.

I craved to feel like that again. Every. Single. Day. But it was exactly like eating candy. It was not good for me. Because ultimately by standing in the limelight I showed everybody everything I wanted to hide. The rolls of fat and sweaty pits. The acne marks, the wild hair, the extra hair. The short height. The old clothes that didn't fit very well because they were secondhand. The lack of confidence. The shame of being, well, me.

"What happens if I don't do this?" I asked, softly, but my voice still traveled all around the room.

He'd been getting his guitar out of its case when he stopped and blinked at me. "I... guess the school probably won't like it very much."

God damn it, he was right. Just like during the interview, I had to do whatever it took to keep my position, graduate and get the hell away.

I steeled my spine and stepped into the room. My steps echoed around me. Great acoustics. As soon as I opened my mouth and sang a note there was going to be nowhere to hide.



I sat across from him and lifted my chin. "Now what?"

Ashton, Ash, whatever, set his guitar on his lap and looked at me but didn't look at me. It was that look that people who were bored out of their wits carried, even though they tried to be nice and polite.

"And now," he said. "You show me what you got."

I blinked. "I'm going to need a bit more than that."

"Okay." He looked down at his guitar and played a note. "Sing it. That's a A minor 7 chord."

"A what, what?" I drew in a shaky breath. I was so out of my depth.

He gave a tight smile and played it again. "Sing it."

I did.

Blue eyes narrowed slightly. "Let's do the classic do re mi. I'll play a note and sing it, so you get used to how your voice should sound next to an instrument."

I nodded. He played and sang the notes. His voice was clear, deep and I felt it all the way to my bones. I rubbed my arms to hide the goosebumps.

As the second do note came, I sang along. He looked at me this time. For real.

"So you have no training at all?"

I scratched my left elbow. "My ma was a singer. Well, not professionally. But she taught me how to sing since I was a kid."

He bit his lower lip and I tried not to focus on the motion. "In Spanish?"

"Mostly, yeah." I shrugged. "But I can sing in English too, of course. I just don't know any of that... like, reading music sheet and stuff. My previous school didn't even have music lessons. I knew a kid who would rap in the cafeteria during lunch break, but that was it."

Oh, I was blabbering and I couldn't seem to stop. It was like he'd dislodged my tongue with that little bite of his lip.

Shit. Why wasn't there anybody else in this room?

He hummed low in his throat, assessing me. "Why don't you sing whatever impressed Mr. Burlington so much?"

"I..." I dragged the word. "Don't really think you want to listen to that."

"Why not?"

This time I smirked. "I sang Let it Go from Frozen."

I motioned at him for emphasis. Hot guy? Check? Guitar? Check. Black Nirvana t-shirt under his uniform shirt? Check. Although probably poser fashion. What did a rich, white boy have to complain about?

One thing was certain. I said, "you don't seem the type to enjoy Disney music."

He leaned back in his chair. "Don't judge a book by its cover. Do your worst."

He folded his arms like he was going nowhere until I went all Elsa on his ass. He was goading me and I knew it, but at the same time I wanted to see him squirm in the discomfort of hearing what was probably the least manly song of the decade. And so without warning I stood up and gave it to him. I dished it all out again, like I was freaking Elsa sending flurries of snow all around me. Just as I'd imagine if I were alone in my room. His pretty face went from amiable at the beginning of the song, to shell shocked by the time I reached the first chorus. I was also a little stunned by my voice bouncing back form the walls of the room but I covered it up by more theatre as I reached a crescendo.

I sure as fuck was never going back. The perfect girl I sought everywhere did not exist. It was only me. I closed my eyes and opened my voice until it grew bigger than me, bigger than this room, and let that final high note go along with my breath.



I finished the song with a gasp that had me crashing back down into the room. Into the moment. As if I'd flown somewhere else.

Ashton sat immobile.

A crowd had formed outside the door. People with overalls and paint splashes. A couple of nuns.

"I'm sorry!" I said, as a reflex.

After the high, the low always came. It was so embarrassing to realize that I had no business claiming for attention so hard. That I was supposed to be a faceless person in the crowd.

I scrambled to grab my backpack and Ashton jumped out of his chair. In a few long strides he shut the doors and kept the onlookers outside. He stayed there, back glued to the door but his eyes on me. He swallowed a couple of times.

"Why are you sorry?" His voice sounded raspy. As if he were the one who'd gone all Broadway in here.

I fiddled with my backpack straps. "I was probably too loud. They were coming to complain."

"Hell no." He snorted. "They came over because they thought Idina Menzel was here."

I got hung up on one fact. "How do you know who sings a Disney song?"

"She won an Oscar, of course I'd know." He ran both hands through his hair like he was having trouble processing the situation. "I'll find you some books on learning sheet music, but that's not what you need."

I needed a plastic surgeon, really, but I doubted he could find me one in the library.

Ashton shook his head. "Your voice is dying to come out. What you really need is someone to bring you out of that shell of yours."

I opened and closed my mouth. My hands went up and latched onto my hair, trying to brush it. I looked at the wooden floor. I looked up at him furtively. "Yeah, well. I don't think music can get me out of my shell, trust me. It's harder than steel."

"Music can do anything." The vehemence with which he said this rooted me to the floor. Ashton breached the distance between us, slowly, like I was pray he was stalking. He bit his lower lip again. "Vera, will you let me help you become who you're meant to be?"

I choked. I kid you not. My attempt at swallowing my own saliva backfired.

"What?" he asked.

After a round of coughs I asked him, "Do you tell that to all the girls?"

This time his smile showed all his teeth. "Only to the ones that matter."

♪ Losing My Resistance ♪

The next morning when I woke up there was an envelop that had been slid under our door. I picked it up and saw that it was addressed to me. Since I'd learned that the bathrooms were shared with the entire floor, I'd decided to wake up extra early every morning so that I could do my thing around the least amount of people possible. So I took the note with me and didn't bother Addy by turning a light on to read it.

The bathroom was actually pretty nice, stocked with enough towels and toiletries for an army, rather than the 24 girls that used it every day. There was actually enough privacy if one cared for it, with screens, curtains and a small changing room. I got down to my skivvies quickly and put my stuff away in my locker. I was used to a quick and furtive shower ever since ma and I moved in with the gringo. For some reason I always felt like he was on the lookout and it creeped me the hell out. That habit was serving me well at the boarding school and it would take me only 20 minutes to be clean and dressed again.

I sat on the bench by the lockers and pulled out the note in the envelop. It was from Mother Superior Evangeline. She requested to see me in her office before class.

I looked at the clock hanging from the wall. It was only past 7am. There was still just shy of an hour before breakfast was served, and the first class was at 9. I wondered if it was too early to drop by her office. I went back to my room and opened the door trying to make the least amount of noise. Addy still groaned.

"Sorry," I hissed, tip toeing around to drop my stuff and grab my backpack. She murmured something, followed by a snore.

I shook my head as I left my room. I wouldn't describe myself as a morning person, but Addy definitely couldn't be confused for one. Every morning was a struggle to her and I tried not to add to it.

The headmistress's office was the same one I was interviewed at, so I remembered where to find it. I made my way down to the first floor and veered right until I found the massive wood doors. I knocked on them. To my surprise they opened and the senior-most nun stood in front of me. Her glasses had been hanging from her neck, so she put them on.

"Oh, it's you." She stepped aside. "Come right in."

As I did so I said, "Good morning."

She nodded and returned the greeting. Once she was sitting behind her desk, which I thought made her look like a hobbit, and I'd sat on the guest chair in front of her, was when she went straight to business. "You must be wondering why I called you in."

I clasped my hands together. "Did I do something wrong already?"

"Already?" Somehow that made her crack a smile. "You sound certain that you'll make a mistake."

I shrugged one shoulder. "I'm not used to good things happening to me without some sort of catch."

The Mother Superior leaned forward on her elbows. "And you think there's a catch?"



I regarded her in silence with the feeling that she knew exactly what I meant, and that it was exactly the reason why I sat there.

"The catch is that I have to join the music program, isn't it?"

Her face stretched into a smile that temporarily erased a lot of her wrinkles. "Mr. Burlington told me you didn't look too excited when he announced that."

I sank further into the plush chair. "I'm terrified."

"Why?"

It wasn't complicated. It was stupid and I didn't want to explain it. It cut too close to the heart of the matter, which was that I wasn't good enough.

Instead of answering her question, I asked one of my own. "What happens if I don't want to join the program? Can I just focus on the regular curriculum?"

She stood up and paced to the large window that oversaw the grounds. The sun was coming up in the sky, painting it with hues of purples and pinks. "That'd be unfortunate. You see, every student here has to focus on their studies and their talents. Your ability to memorize text is not what got you, or any of them, into this academy." She turned to me. "Do you have any other talent that you could pursue under our tutelage?"

I didn't think the talents of fucking things up or gaining weight out of thin air were part of her curriculum. I also didn't have the talent of being born with a silver spoon in my mouth.

My lips trembled. "Not really."

Mother Superior nodded to herself. "I was really shocked, you know. We had to give the opportunity of interviewing to the rest of the qualifying applicants, but as soon as I heard you I knew you were being wasted in a public school without a hefty music program. God's given you an extraordinary gift."

I felt my face burn. Yes, I'd got compliments before. But none had been like this. They hadn't made me feel like I had what it took to reach for the stars.

"Thank you," I heard myself say with a voice that sounded like someone else's.

"It's not too late, you know," she said, sitting back down across from me. "If you work really hard and set your mind to it, I think you could make singing into your career."

My jaw dropped. That was what my mother had tried and failed at. She'd set her mind and heart out into becoming a singer since she was my age or younger. She worked every day and night and left everything behind for it. She'd begged producers and record labels. She'd sang at every bar and show that would have her. She sent her demos to every major, medium and small label that she could think of. To every radio station of her genre. But breaking into the music industry was harder than going to outer space, and all she'd gotten for her efforts was... me.

I took a deep breath. "I don't think that's for me."

"Very well, but that's what got you into this school, so at the very least you should use it to get you to where you actually want to be." Her head tilted to the side. "Do you know where that is, precisely?"

I'd never thought farther than finding a way to get out of the gringo's house. I could become an accountant, a hair stylist or a cashier at a restaurant. Just as long as I wasn't in the barrio.

She must have read the turmoil in my face, because she waved a hand. "Well, you have one year to figure it out and we can help you."

This was uncharted territory to me. Someone helping me without any interest. Because I was a scholarship student, so she didn't have the incentive of me paying for tuition in exchange for guidance. The only thing she asked for was that I joined the music program and, what was it that the queen bee had said? Go to national competitions?



Easy peasy lemon squeezy, right?

More like difficult difficult lemon difficult, but I had to if I wanted to keep my place.

I stood up. "Thank you. I'll make sure to work hard in the music program."

She smiled. "You're welcome."

I had a feeling she wanted to say something more but a knock came from the door. She stood up with a grunt.

"Jesus, all of you students sure got up early today."

My jaw hung a little as she used His name in vain. I was pretty sure that was a no-no.

She headed over to the door and opened it. I stifled a gasp as my eyes met Ashton's. It was a natural reaction I was developing at seeing his pretty face.

"Mr. Winters," the Mother Superior said, motioning inside. "Please come in, I was just wrapping up with Vera."

He walked in, guitar case hanging from his shoulder. I noticed that he never carried books around. I broke the eye contact by looking down at my new shoes.

"I'll see myself out," I said.

"Thank you, Vera Maria." She looked at me with a thoughtful expression. "A name and a voice from the heavens, huh?"

Ashton's eyebrows went up.

I nearly ran out of the room and shut the massive door behind me. I did wonder for a second what she wanted to talk with him about, but the niggling feeling in the back of my head propelled me all the way to the cafeteria. I had the same feeling every time he was around. Like I had to stay away from him if I wanted to stay the same as I was.

I was early enough that I could see all the cafeteria staff come in and begin the setup. I parked myself at what was going to become Addy's and my usual table, close to the buffet, and took out my cellphone looking for something to kill some time with. I scrolled through my Facebook feed and saw a few pictures from the kids at my previous school. Leti appeared in a few of them. I zoomed in on one of them and whistled low at her makeup. Step aside, Kim Kardashian.

Then I saw that she'd posted a #tbt with me.

The phone jumped from my hands as though I'd been shocked by something. I found her on WhatsApp and sent her a quick text. She replied right away like usual, as though we hadn't spent a solid week not talking to each other. But I wasn't about to bring that up when I was just floating in the air that we were on speaking terms again.

We were in a frenzy of text exchanges, catching up with the latest, as a few sleepy eyed kids started walking into the cafeteria. The food was laid out already but I didn't care. I was busy telling her everything from my new roommate, to this whole shebang of me having no choice but to sing for the school, and grossly glossing over the pretty boy so she wouldn't act too crazy. She told me DeAndre asked her out and I squealed like a pig, which was when Addy found me.

"Whoa, what was that?" she asked as she set her tray down and perused our table. "And where's your food?"

"I'll go get it in a second." I gave her a big shit-eating grin. "My best friend just got asked out by her crush and it was all because of me."

She struggled for a moment opening her yogurt parfait but once she opened it she said, "Oooh, other people's gossip. My favorite."

I started telling her all about it when a second person dropped their tray on our table. Addy and I both jumped out of our skins as Ashton sat with us.

"Good morning," he said, like it was the most typical thing. And I guessed it was, just not directed at us.

Every single eye from all the early birds was on us.

"Um, what are you doing here?" I asked him.

He bent down and pulled up a black backpack on his lap. He unzipped it and pulled out three thick books that he set in front of me.

"I'm here to give you these," he said. I peered down at the books. Reading Music. The Classics. Music Theory for Dummies. I looked back up at him. "Here's the plan," he started, unprompted. "You have a week to study these. I'll quiz you. We'll meet every day after class this week before music club officially meets, and even after that. You'll practice with me and do as I say. No questions, no complaints. Is that clear?"

My hackles were officially raised. "Who died and put you in charge?"

Addy looked from him, to me, and back to him.

Ashton shrugged. "No one died, but Mother Superior Evangeline just put me in charge. If you have any complaints take them to her."

As he grabbed his tray and things again, and stood up, I said, "You're loco, amigo."

The left corner of his lips raised into a smirk. "And I'll drive you loca. The sooner you accept that the better off you'll be."

♪ Jog ♪ I stood face to face with Ashton. Well, face to chest. I had to crane my head back to meet his eye. He had his arms folded and was looking down at me like he wanted to start a fight. I lifted an eyebrow.

"Ready?" he asked me.

"Are you?" I asked back.

His lips twitched, but he didn't respond to that. He counted backward form three, and when he hit one we both took a deep breath and let it loose between our lips. The result was a fart-like sound. We repeated it one more time together. Then we did the do re mi scale forward, and backward. We kept doing warm up exercises for a solid five minutes. He'd taught them to me after it turned out that the Mother Superior had commanded him to work with me, and so every after school special with him — his words, not mine — had to start this way. It was Friday, our third and last lesson of the week, and I couldn't wait for the weekend so that I could catch up on all the freaking homework I hadn't been able to do because of these lessons.

I couldn't begin to explain how ridiculous I felt doing the exercises. Or how hilarious it was that this intensely good looking guy didn't give two shits about joining in, too. The whole thing was weird.

He clasped twice when he thought I was ready. "Okay, I called in some extra help for today."

We both looked at the music room's door as it opened, as if on cue. I recognized the guy from our class. He also sat at the back but on the opposite corner, always wore black Beats headphones around his neck, and his hair was even longer than mine.

"Glad you could make it." I detected some sarcasm in Ashton's voice.

The other boy grunted as he bee lined toward the piano next to us. He sat by it and looked up at me, as if noticing me for the first time.

"I heard you're good. If you're not, I won't waste my time any further here."

Well, no pressure then.

I rolled my eyes. "Nice to meet you, I'm Vera."

"Lincoln Choi." He pulled a strand of glossy black hair behind his ear. "I'm the pianist for the orchestra."

Ashton leaned his elbow on the closed piano. "Link here has won a few awards for his piano skills. But I wouldn't call him a prodigy because of that."

Link glared at him and my jaw dropped.

"You have a really lousy way of asking people for help if that's how you treat them," I said.

Ashton laughed and Link narrowed his eyes at me. The latter said, "careful, one more insult at him and you may be this close to getting on my good books."

"What I meant to say is," Ashton continued, waving a hand. "That he's a prodigy at other aspects of music. He's a composer and producer, and he's here to help me find out what your vocal range is."



I felt like I was slapped in the face. A composer and producer?

"Professionally?" I asked, but they ignored me.

"I'll play a key," Link said, exemplifying. "You'll sing it. Easy. Three screw ups and I'm out."

"She won't screw up," Ashton said with much more confidence than I felt. He looked at me. "Ready?"

"Wait." I lifted my palm up. "What are you going to do?"

you He folded his arms again. "I'm going to observe."

Link played a key with no warning. I realized I was supposed to join in already, so I tried to sing it as best as I could. This went on for a while. With every new key my voice went higher and higher. He plunged me to the low keys all of a sudden, and it became harder to follow along as he switched around between what I felt like low, high and medium. All the while Ashton walked slow circles around me. At some point he pushed my shoulders back, forcing my spine straight. It did ease the knot in my throat and my voice came out clearer. I didn't know how long we did this, but I did notice that Link hadn't just up and left.

He stopped at random and looked at Ashton. "A solid mezzo-soprano."

I was panting by that point and felt a trickle of sweat down my brow. And I hadn't even moved. I didn't know how my ma had managed to sing for entire shows and dance at the same time.

Ashton nodded. "Figures."

Link touched his chin and narrowed his sharp eyes. "In the dramatic range, I think."

The other boy seemed surprised at this. "Really? Well, shit. That explains everything."

I looked from one to the other. "Care to explain? You're speaking in tongues to me."

It was the blue eyed demon who did. "You have the perfect voice for an orchestra. I'm surprised that old man Burlington caught onto that from the get go."

Link shrugged. "Well, he did recruit me into this school."

me The other boy stood in front of me again and stared down at me. "The problem is that your stamina is abysmal. You won't last when we start club next week."

"You should teach her a few of the pieces we'll start with. She won't have much time to prepare before our first recital." Link stood up and grabbed his messenger bag. "As for the stamina, you'll need a miracle because all you have is a few days before the first club session."

I rubbed my hands on my skirt. My scholarship was on the line. "Um, what can I do to improve?"

"Pray," he said. With a salute he left the music room.

The look on Ashton's eyes gave me the shivers. Like I was in trouble.

"Follow me."

Like a dumb moron I did. We grabbed our stuff and left the music room. On our way out we passed the arts room and I caught Addy's eye. She looked up from cutting fabric and waved at me. Her smile didn't falter even as I pretended to choke and die. Ash didn't wait for me and I had to scramble to catch up. We left the building and went outside, where it seemed like half of the school was hanging out. Addy told me that a lot of people stayed in the school over the weekend, and for this one it seemed like most of the kids were more interested in catching up than on going back home.

I spotted the queen bee and her king laying on the grass by the lake. We caught her eye as we made our way across the lawn and I could feel it glued to the back of my head even as we entered the sports hall.

That was where I stopped. "What are we doing here?"

"You'll see," was all he said.

Like a dumb moron I did, part two. We walked across the basketball court, where a couple of guys were having a one on one. I finally realized what was up when we made it into the area with machines and weights, because of course this school had that for the athletes, too.



Ashton grabbed my backpack and pushed me onto a treadmill.

"What the hell?"

He stood in front of me, elbows on the console of the treadmill. "Do you know any rap songs?"

I frowned.

"First of all, are you implying that I'm out of shape?" I asked, folding my arms as if that could disguise the fact that I was hurt because, yeah, I was hella out of shape.

He rolled his eyes. "Not you. Your lungs are."

"I fail to see how a treadmill is going to help."

"Cardiovascular activity is exactly what your lungs need. We'll have to do this every day for it to work, though."

"Why do you care?" I snapped. "Who cares if I run out of breath?"

He ignored my questions. "Well? Do you know any rap songs or not?"

My lips turned into a sad frown. "A couple, why?"

Ashton walked to the side and fiddled with the controls, setting the machine in motion at a pace that I could follow with no trouble. If I were less of a pushover, I wouldn't even have followed him out of the music room, but I was half curious to see where he was going with this, and half afraid if whatever this was didn't work that I'd be kicked out of the school. Because ultimately, it was the powers that be whom cared if I ran out of breath.

After a few minutes of this I realized that I wasn't even breaking into a sweat, so I asked him what the deal was.

He stood in front of me again with his arms crossed over the console and his chin resting on them. He was impossibly cute when he looked up at me, eyebrows slightly raised, hair side sweeping over his brow.

"And now, you sing."

"What?"

"The rap song. Which is it?" he asked.

My brains did a scramble to find the name of one of my usuals at parties. "Shoop by Salt N Pepa."

He whistled low. "Hit it, then."

I took a deep breath and started the song. By the time I got to the first chorus I felt like I didn't have enough air to keep my brain alive. The words started to twist on my tongue and the verses came shorter and with more time in between. A despicable little twist curved his lips.

"I hate you," I said as I finished the song and took a breath, pausing the machine and panting as if I'd ran to the football field and back.

"Good." He climbed onto the treadmill next to mine and started it too. "Let's sing one together, just so you don't think I won't take my own medicine."

Ashton fucking winked at me.

I pushed the curtain of my hair back and raised my head toward him. "You're both a sadist and a masochist? Because this is awful."

He snorted a short laugh. "Link would have loved you for that one."

"Are you guys friends?" I asked. "I've never seen you with him."

He glanced at me. "It almost sounds like you've been watching me."

I looked down and started the machine again just so that I had something else to do other than look like an idiot.

"Don't twist my words, I didn't mean it like that."

I could almost feel the smile in his voice. "I know. But anyway, I wouldn't say we're friends. I wouldn't say we're not friends, either."



I did a double take at him. "What does that even mean?"

He looked up at the ceiling, hands in his pockets, as he walked. Which I didn't think was very safe. "Hey, do you know the lyrics to Bring Me To Life?"

"To what?"

This made him stop. He grabbed hold of the handle bars just before sliding back and climbed onto the sides. Then he gave me a stupefied look. When that didn't get him a reaction from me, he pulled out his cellphone and showed me a video on Youtube. The song was familiar, but I didn't know it enough to sing it.

I shrugged. "Sorry, this is white people music."

"What?" He looked offended now. That was a first. "Rock is not white people music. As a matter of fact, its early roots are in blues."

"Oh, I didn't know that." I pushed a strand of my wavy hair behind my ear and smiled at him. "In other words, it's people of color music that white people appropriated."

He looked away, blinking, but I was surprised that he didn't snap at me for that. He looked almost pensive. "You may be right," he surprised me by saying. "In its early form, yes. But nowadays, rock is supposed to be for anybody who feels like they don't belong."

A shiver racked my spine, and I had nothing to blame it on but his words.

Of course I'd heard rock songs. I didn't seek them out, instead they found me at stores or on random radio stations when I was on the car with my friends or my ma and her man. And usually we just changed the station to something a bit more tropical. Something that was more about living la vida loca.

I'd never actually thought about rock music in the terms that Ashton did.

My attention shifted back to him. "Do you feel like you don't belong?"

His blue eyes darkened to a shade I thought was impossible. Here was a person who commanded admiration and parted the people like Moses parted the ocean. Who was gorgeous. Rich. Hot. And for some reason he seemed to think there was no room for him.

What hope was there for me?

He grabbed his phone again and fiddled around with it before he handed it back to me. "Here's a lyrics video. Try to learn the song."

I frowned. "Right now?"

"Yeah, I'll wait."

I looked at him skeptically. "It's not that quick to learn a song, you know."

"I have faith in you."

That was probably the first time someone had said that to me, and it had his desired effect. I stopped my treadmill and gave the song two listens without trying to replicate. I read the lyrics and for some reason all I could think about was a vampire and how she was being brought to life by a boy. Maybe the random male singer. I thought it was kind of a strange song but there was some intensity to it that was getting under my skin. At the third listen I forgot that I wasn't alone and got really into it. I noted the low and high points in the song, the inflections of emotion and the releases, those parts where you felt like you were floating back down from a high.

I found myself loving the song.

Suddenly he joined in, singing the guy's parts. When the song ended we started again. I set his phone on the treadmill so I could read the lyrics and injected as much drama into the words as I could. I felt out of breath and my throat was hurting a bit, but I was determined to keep up the pace. By the fifth attempt even Ashton was struggling. When we both gave up for the day, we were drenched in sweat and I felt like I was about to puke.

He lifted his hand. I just stared at it, so he grabbed my wrist and forced me to high five him.

"Good job," he rasped out.

"Oh, God." I looked up at the ceiling. "Please tell me this was the first and only time we'll do this."

He laughed. "No. This won't be the last time I leave you worn out."

I smacked his arm hard. "Pervert."

♪ The Diary of Vera ♪

Saturday morning I rolled on my bed, blissful in the knowledge that I could sleep in for a bit. My roommate's snores lulled me back to sleep, until a knock on our door woke us both up.

"It's Sister Louisa, may I come in?"

Groggy, we both gave an affirmation. I picked up my phone and saw that it was only 7.30am.

She opened the door just enough to pop her head in. "Good morning girls." We tried to wish her the same but it came out like unintelligible mumbles. "Vera, your mom is here to pick you up."

That snapped me awake. "What? Why?"

She smiled. "Because it's the weekend."

"But," I said as I lifted my bed sheets, which were much more comfortable than the ones at the gringo's house. "I have a lot of homework I was meaning to catch up on this weekend. I told her to not pick me up."

Sister Louisa's Mona Lisa smile didn't change. "She's waiting for you in the headmistress's office. I suggest you hurry."

She closed the door behind her and I looked at Addy with desperation oozing from my pores.

She blinked, slowly. "I take it you don't want to go."

"No."

But I knew there was little choice, so I stood up and collected the necessities. I tried to hurry in the bathroom but by the time I made it downstairs and saw her, my ma looked like I'd made her wait three whole hours.

"Vera Maria," she used that tone, the one that when I was a kid was followed by a flying chancla. "Do you have everything you need?"

that I gave my best fake smile, because the Mother Superior was looking at us. "I thought I had to put in a request to the school for weekend leave. I didn't put one in this time."

The nun pushed her glasses up the bridge of her nose. "True, but your parents can just come and pick you up, too."

With pursed lips I realized that no matter what tactic I tried I couldn't outsmart my mother. I thought I could hide from her for most of the year, but how wrong was I. Once we were in the car, with all my things in the trunk, she revealed the real reason why she picked me up. And it wasn't because she missed me.

"One of the girls cancelled." She pulled the car out of the school's parking lot. I recognized the streets she drove down on. I also recognized the mansion she pulled into. "I brought your uniform."

Panic seized me by the throat. I could not be seen by Ashton cleaning in his home again. Mad as I'd been that he hadn't recognized me the first time, I was probably luckier that way. What if he had and then had told everybody in school? Everybody would make fun of me. I'd be an example to Addy on what an outcast really was.



I didn't want to see the look on his face if he saw me this time, because now he'd recognize me for sure.

"Um," I said, not yet moving from the passenger's seat. My eyes glued on the massive house. "Don't you have another job going on this weekend that I could do instead?"

My ma turned off the car and gave me a look that was equal parts mad and confused. "Since when do I work two houses at the same time, niña? Are you crazy?"

I looked down at my lap. "No, I-" But I stopped myself. I couldn't tell her that this was my classmate's house. She wouldn't care. She might even get mad that I do.

I followed her into the house and changed into the uniform in the service restroom. I gathered all my hair into a net, hoping that that alone would make me unrecognizable. I looked at myself in the mirror and shook my head. No dice. I was still glaringly Vera. I didn't know how Superman did it.

I sent God a quick prayer, asking that Ashton had stayed back at the school this weekend.

The other girl who was going to be part of today's cleaning efforts joined us in the kitchen. Ma gave us the usual spiel about not bothering the house owners, no eye contact, only good morning and sorry. She divided the work into the three of us, calculating that it'd take us about eight hours each. The breaks were accounted for as well, and for each one we'd meet there in the kitchen where she could keep track of us. We had to have our cellphones with us at all times, but not use them during the work hours or so help us.

I headed upstairs, mumbling curses under my breath but thankful that at least I hadn't got assigned to what I now knew was Ashton's room. I swore to myself that one day I'd stop being a follower. That I'd stop obeying everybody else's command and just do whatever the hell I wanted. But that day wasn't going to be today, and I had a lot to clean.

My starting room looked like a cross between a library and an office. The entire perimeter was made of wood shelves, from floor to ceiling, full to the brim with tomes that were rimmed in gold or looked older than Nana. In the middle sat a desk that put the Mother Superior's to shame. This one was more like a long table, where about six people could sit to have a meal if it weren't for all the drawers. I mumbled some colorful words in Spanish and cursed my luck. Eight unexpected hours of hard work were going to leave me four hours for homework today at best.

I decided to start by the desk. I put all the papers, binders and books into a pile on the chair and set out to wipe the wood surface with a special cleaning agent that would make it shine like new. Afterward I rearranged all the documents exactly the same way I found them. I was pretty good at that. Little details that I worked on so that I wouldn't bother others.

The door opened and I looked up on reflex. My eyes met those of a man that seemed larger than life. I quickly looked down and mumbled a weak good morning.

Without a shred of doubt, that was Ashton's father. Same eyes, but with a lot more steel on them. Same nose and face, but aged. Unlike his son, though, he carried a vibe that made me stand straighter and almost salute in attention.

"Don't worry," he said. "I'm just here to pick up some papers."

I stood to the side, rag and can of cleaning stuff in hand. I looked down at the Persian carpet that I hadn't got around to vacuuming yet. He rummaged around the stuff on his desk, opened a few drawers, grunting every time he came up short with whatever he was looking for.

I cleared my throat. "Could I help you, sir?"

Ma was going to have my head for that, but I felt stifled under his presence and wanted him to go as soon as possible before I started asking for forgiveness for a crime I hadn't committed.



He put his hands on his waist. "Maybe you can, I'm looking for a red folder embossed with the logo of Congress."

I dropped my jaw.

He seemed almost amused. "Since, I'm a Senator for Florida, and all."

"Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't know."

I didn't. I had no idea that my classmate and the bane of my existence as of late was the son of a senator. I felt more out of place in his presence than ever before.

"I'm Albert Winters, at your service and the people of the sunshine state."

The smile I plastered on my face was as fake as if I'd bought it off of Walmart. "It's an honor, sir."

"Now," he said as he clapped once and looked around. "It's a regular A4 folder and I need it before I fly to DC in a couple of hours."

Suddenly almost every tome in the shelves seemed red to me. I started pulling some of them out and back in when I didn't find the Congress logo. I heard him rummage around on the opposite end of the room. This was insane. I was in a senator's house. Me, a dirt poor Latina. I hoped he didn't think I was undocumented.

From the corner of my eye I caught glimpse of a red thing under a heavy book on what I assumed was the coffee table by the window. I pulled it out and said, "Ah hah!"

I turned around with a pleased smile. I felt like I'd helped my country somehow.

"Thank you." He took it and opened the folder, nodding once. "This is the one."

I clasped my hands behind my back. "No, thank you, sir."

He gave me one last glance. "I'll make sure to tip you well."

Color rushed to my face. I wouldn't complain for some more money, but I hadn't done much to deserve it and all of a sudden I felt embarrassed. I was able to breathe again once he left the room and left the doors spread open. I looked around and thought it was a bit too messy for me to leave it the same as I'd found it. The best detail I could have this time was to leave it more organized, and that way a freaking state senator wouldn't lose his important documents.

More nervous than ever I continued cleaning and putting order on things. I vacuumed the carpet with extreme care. The thing was probably as expensive as the entire book collection.

The machine was so loud that I didn't hear someone come in until I almost vacuumed his toes. I looked up and screamed as Ashton stood before me. The vacuum fell to the floor and for some reason my next instinct was to run away.

Of course, he blocked me easily.

"Well, well, well," he said once I gave up in trying to outmaneuver him. "Who do we have here."

"Shut up," I told him, now definitely sending all my ma's instructions to hell. "Not a word."

He put his hands in the pockets of his sweatpants. "I didn't know you worked as a cleaning maid."

I lifted the vacuum and turned it off, giving him a look that came straight from copying ma when she was angry. "Okay, stop pretending. You might have forgot my face the first time, but seeing me a second time in your home should have jolted your memory."

He ran a hand through his silky hair. "What are you talking about?"

I paused, really looking at him and seeing the confusion patent on his face. It seemed real, unless he was a damn good actor.

"You really don't remember?"

His brows came together as he looked me up and down. I felt goosebumps where his eyes swept over me. I felt like I was being measured and found to come up short. But no taunting came. Instead his face turned even more stunned.



"You've been here before?"

I folded my arms. "Yes. I was in your bathroom, remember?"

He shook his head, and a sense of urgency seemed to wash over him. His whole body seemed electrified all of a sudden. He breached the distance between us and grabbed me by the shoulders. I had to crane my head back to look up at him. A question was lodged in my throat.

"You saw him."

"Who?" I managed to ask.

"My brother."

My jaw dropped. "Does he look exactly the same as you?"

He swallowed hard and stepped back, seeming to realize that he was acting weird. He rubbed his eyes and looked around him. "We're twins, and he's been missing for weeks."

My brains were leaking out of my ears. The picture he was painting did not match. If that was his brother I'd seen, he'd looked totally fine — in more ways than one. Like he hadn't been in imminent danger. And he couldn't be, because otherwise his entire family would probably be freaking out. Ashton wouldn't have been so calm at school, and his senator father probably wouldn't be taking trips to DC and abandoning his family in their time of need.

I did recall the boy asking me not to tell anyone that I'd seen him.

I told this to Ashton, whose eyes narrowed.

"That bastard." He huffed as he paced. "So he's close by, huh?"

I lifted my hands up. "I know it's none of my business, but what's going on?"

He stopped and glanced at me over his shoulder. "Well, what's going on is that my brother, the person I trust the most in the world, told our parents this summer that he's gay and ran away from home. And won't tell even me where he is."

My eyes went wide as saucers.

"I, uh, don't know what to say."

He smiled. "But now you've given me a clue to find him."

Stomping steps were heard then and my ma rushed into the room. "Vera Maria! What are you doing?" She gave Ashton one look and started apologizing profusely for bothering him.

"She's not bothering me," he said, not at all catching that my ma's undertone was one of murder. "We're friends."

"We're what?" I asked.

My ma did the same. "Excuse me?"

He looked between us. "Yeah, we go to Trinity together."

My ma's lips pursed into a tight line. I didn't know what she was thinking, but all I knew was that I was fucked.

"I see."

He wasn't a total idiot. He could detect that something was up. "Well, I'll uh, see myself out."

As he slipped out of the room, and cursed me to deal with my ma by myself, she stomped over and smacked my arm. "What have I told you a million times? Don't go talking with the owners! Imagine my surprise when the senator found me downstairs and slid $100 at me because you helped him find a document. And now I find you here chit chatting with his son? What is wrong with you?"

As my jaw hung I was wondering more like what was wrong with this family. A Florida Senator with a gay runaway son and another one who had a streak of crazy that he couldn't hide if he tried.

"You're absolutely right, ma," I told her, to her obvious shock. "I have no business meddling with these people."

I left her stunned to retrieve the vacuum and set back to work again, with a feeling that those words would haunt me.

♪ This Is How You Charm Me ♪ I was proven right a couple of hours later.

We were in the kitchen taking our lunch break and going over the areas in the house we had left, when Ashton glided in. And that was what he did. The smooth entrance couldn't be attributed to the mere act of walking. It was also how my trouble-meter flared to life.

I was glad to not be the only person who found it strange. Ma looked at him like he was the second weirdest person she'd ever met, after me, and the other cleaning girl chocked on her sandwich as she saw him.

"Are you okay?" he asked her.

My ma plastered on a smile and set her food down on the plate, ignoring the other girl as she gulped large quantities of water down. "Can we help you with something?"

As the other girl recovered he shifted his attention to my ma. "Yes, well. I just a got call from the school. Vera and I have to go back, I'm afraid."

That caught me in the middle of taking a bite and I froze, my sandwich hovering just shy of my chompers.

I so wanted it to be true, but I was afraid that if I said anything my ma would dismiss it all as a lie.

Kudos to my ma for keeping the pleasant facade intact. Her teeth almost shone as she smiled. "What do you mean?"

Ashton slowly leaned on the kitchen island. He looked down and bit his lower lip. Then he looked up. That was what I had come to recognize as his killer look. From the corner of my eyes I saw the other two women visibly melt. Not even Victoria Cecilia de la Cruz Vazquez was immune.

"Mr. Burlington, the advisor for the senior year, just called me. It turns out that we've been fit in as a last minute replacement for a different orchestra that was supposed to play for the children's hospital benefit next weekend. We need to start rehearsals ASAP."

But my ma was stronger and more stubborn than anyone gave her credit for. She took a sip of water and asked him, "What does that have to do with my daughter?"

Ashton's eyebrows went up. He looked at me for only a second. "She's the lead singer of the orchestra."

My ma and the other girl turned to me. The latter with some admiration. The former couldn't care two shits.

"Is she," my ma said in a way that was not at all a question. She took a bite of her sandwich. I knew this tactic. She'd used it on me a million times when she wanted me to think she already knew what I'd done and make me panic on my own. It usually worked like a charm, but Ashton didn't seem to be crumbling under the pressure.

He pulled out his cellphone, tapped it a couple of times and handed it to her. "I'm dialing the school, feel free to confirm for yourself."

Skeptical as fuck, my ma took the phone from him, checked the number on it and I guessed she must have memorized it, because she seemed to trust it. She put the phone on her ear and started at whomever picked up on the other side.



"Yes, hi. This is Victoria de la Cruz, I'm Vera's mother," she said to it, turning her back to us. "May I speak with the Mother Superior?"

As she waited to speak with her, I turned to Ashton. The smile on his face was freaking me out a bit. When he winked at me I freaked out a lot more.

"Hello," my ma said, louder. "I just wanted to confirm — ah, yes. Is it true?"

My eyes went wide as saucers as my ma's face slid from polite to irritated, then to resigned.

"Okay, thank you. I will." After that she hung up and handed Ashton his phone in return. Without looking at me she said, "Vera Maria, grab your things from the car and go back to school. It seems they do need you."

Was that what winning the lottery felt like?

I looked up, thanking the Lord for this miracle. Telling Him I would never doubt again.

But what I'd told the Mother Superior a few days ago was true. I was not used to good things happening to me without a catch. "Um, ma, are sure? You'll be short handed here."

She waved one hand and fished into her apron pockets with the other one. She produced the car keys and gave them to me. "We made good progress in the morning. Here, come back and give me the key before you go."

I picked the keys from her hand like they were the holy grail of freedom. Still, I tried not to look too pleased, lest my ma got ticked off and decided to call the nuns and tell them to screw off.

I turned away from ma, caught Ashton's eye and mouthed thank you. Aloud I said, "I'll see you in school, then."

He tilted his head. "What do you mean you'll see me there? I'll drive us." When we all looked at him, he just shrugged. "I have a car."

Of course he did. He probably had everything he dreamed of. That was totally not me sounding jealous because I'd always wanted a car for myself, nope.

I decided to count myself lucky already and all but ran out of the kitchen from the service back door. I put the key in the lock in the trunk of ma's car and got my stuff out. I was back in the house in record time. My cheeks hurt from not trying to smile.

Reluctantly ma grabbed the keys back and gave me a kiss on the cheek. "Text me when you're back in school, okay?"

"Yes, ma'am."

"Ready?" Ashton asked, hands in his pockets. Cool as a cucumber, as though he hadn't just disrupted my day, and my weekend, in the best possible way. At that second I couldn't help but like him.

"Yep."

I followed him out the house from the front door. Leaving this mansion felt like leaving a modern day castle, all marble floors and decoration out of a catalogue. Parked out front was a white Jeep, with black letters that read Rubicon. I shook my head. So maybe it wasn't the car I'd have expected him to drive, something low on the ground, in a flashy color and with a loud engine, but at that moment it felt like a carriage that was taking me to the ball with the Prince Charming.

As we climbed into the vehicle I guessed it was Prince Charming, actually, who was driving the carriage to his own party where a princess was waiting for him, and I was actually the mouse companion. He turned on the car and filled the car with the random sounds of commercials on the radio. I waved goodbye at his house as we pulled out into the street and sat back, pleased as punch, to have made such an easy escape.

After a few minutes on the road I noticed that he drove by and away from our boarding school.

With narrow eyes I turned to him. "Um, where are you going?"



His smile made me want to punch him.

"I didn't lie to your mom, but I was thinking we could take a little detour since we just have to be back by curfew and practice starts tomorrow."

"If this detour is leading to a Starbucks I'm fine with that."

Blue eyes flashed to me for a second, but I was glad he kept them on the road. It was only when he pulled to a stop at a red light that he spoke again.

"I think I know where my brother is."

I folded my arms and paraphrased my ma from earlier. "And what does that have to do with me?"

He brushed his fingers through his hair and bit his lower lip. I swatted his thigh.

"Stop doing that!"

Eyes wide he asked, "What?"

"Stop biting your lip and looking up like a puppy. I'm sure it gets you everything you want but stop using it on me."

His lips quirked. "Because it's working?"

"Because it's pissing me off, and if you don't answer my question I'll get violent, and guess what?"

I could tell he was almost on the verge of laughing. "What?" he asked.

"The cops won't care that I beat you up when I tell them you kidnapped me."

Ashton snorted and rolled his eyes. The light turn green and we advanced in the traffic.

"I'm not kidnapping you. It looked to me like you were pretty happy to come." When that reasoning obviously didn't please me he sighed. "To answer your question, nothing. This has nothing to do with you. But I could use with a friend right now."

I looked out the window as we left the pretty houses and moved onto the, still nice, but more middle class areas of Winter Park. We rolled onto Baldwin Park and drove by Metropolitan High School. A way nicer school than the one I'd been attending all my high school career.

I sniffed and looked back at him. "Don't you have a million other friends?"

He gripped the steering wheel just a tad harder. "Not really. I thought I had a handful but that was all my imagination."

If he was referring to Madison and Quinn, I felt kinda bad for bringing that up. I looked down at my clasped hands on my lap and figured that since he'd saved me from at least five more hours of cleaning his house, I'd just cut him a break.

"Okay," I said. "Where's your brother then?"

Instead of answering my question directly he clicked his tongue, hummed deep in his throat, and changed the topic.

"So," he started. "I thought we could take advantage of this trip to start practicing for the recital."

I fixed my best resting bitch face on him. Even though he kept his focus straight on the road, I could tell that it was having an impact on him. His large body recoiled away from me almost all the way to his door.

"You said the word trip." I recognized the steel in my ma's voice in mine. "As in, wherever your brother's at is not Orlando."

He pursed his lips. I noticed we got on the I-4.

"You're correct," he finally said. "He's not in Orlando."

My eyes narrowed to slits. "But he's in Florida, right?"

He nodded. He swallowed hard.

"Ashton." He looked at me. The fact that he looked adorable when he was scared made me even more pissed. I drew in a deep, deep breath. "Where are we going?"

"Sarasota," he spat out.

I shrieked and smacked him where I could reach. His arm, I thought. Then I hit him a second time for good measure. He cringed at the blows.

"Jesus, V. Are you a boxer?"

I had so many questions, but the one I started with was. "Who told you to call me V?" And because he was too slow to answer me I fired a few more. "And did it ever occur to you to, I don't know, ask if I wanted to go to Sarasota? I don't want to get in trouble with the school!" I paused, and looked off into the distance as a sudden thought struck me. "Why do you even think he's there?"

"Finally, an easy question." He had the gall to smile at me. "It's where our crazy aunt that our dad hates lives. She's the only person who could've taken him in in such short notice."

"Crazy aunt, really? And you're taking me there?"

His eyes rolled. "Relax, she's just too much of a hippie for my dad's conservative standards. She's not some psycho who's going to roast you over a bonfire."

"That's reassuring," I said sarcastically.

"And we'll be back on time before curfew." He turned to me and anyone just arriving to this conversation would have thought he looked the picture of innocence. "Trust me."

♪ Vitamin Ashton (Leading Us Along) ♪

Fun story, but the last time a guy asked me to trust him, I'd almost given him my virginity.

I'd been at one of Leti's fave parties last year. We'd got way past tipsy and I'd been dancing with one of DeAndre's friends a bit too tight. He was not as good looking and later I learned definitely not as nice, but he'd paid attention to me that night and we danced well. So well, really, that I let my guard down and let loose. I remembered it like it was yesterday. They'd been playing a classic by Tito El Bambino when he leaned down and whispered in my ear that we should find a room.

We'd stumbled upstairs in between giggles and sloppy kisses, and at that point I hadn't cared about notions like losing my virginity should be with someone I loved and all that jazz. I'd just felt hot and tingly and a boy had touched me in ways I liked.

"Trust me," he'd said once we found an empty room and closed the door.

We started kissing and lost clothing items, one by one. He sat on the bed and pulled me closer. I was drunk on alcohol and hormones and my feet tripped on our clothes. I went flying on him and, well, after that I'd sobered quickly.

It took what felt like an eternity for him to get his breath back, but by that point the nice mood had vanished. As he put on his clothes and glared at me he said words that were engrained in my head. The least insulting of which had been fat .

fat Come to think, that had actually been the last party in the barrio I'd been to. I felt like everybody knew what had happened, or hadn't happened, after that and I just didn't want to deal with their mierda.

I sighed. That all wasn't here or there and I didn't know why I remembered it again. It wasn't like this situation and that had any comparison.

"Okay, I'm sorry." Ashton's voice brought my wandering mind back to my body in his car. "I should've given you a choice."

I folded my arms. "You still could. I mean, there's still time for you to turn around and take me back to school."

That shut him up for a moment.

"I could. If that's what you want?"

I drummed my fingers on my thighs and looked out at the more sparse buildings on the outskirts of the city. If we went back to the school, I'd be able to catch up on my homework. I guess I probably would also have to see what the fuss was about in the music club. I looked at his profile from the corner of my eye. Along the course of a week I'd somehow come to terms with the fact that someone like him was in my life. I didn't think it was going to last because, hey, my life was not a telenovela love story between the rich boy and the poor girl, or even the pretty boy and the ugly duckling girl, but I was kinda curious to see how it could be to hang out with someone who was completely out of my sphere of reach.



"No, not really." I smiled as he startled.

"All that fuss for nothing?"

I shrugged. "Not for nothing. We do have to be back by curfew and we're looking at four hours on the road, to and fro."

"Easy, it's still early."

We did take advantage of the entire two hours on the way to Sarasota for him to educate me on rich people music. He handed me his iPhone to find a few playlists on it. It was locked and I handed it back to him. He just offered me his thumb to place it on the home button. I berated myself for the sparks I felt when I touched his hand.

This was nothing. Just two maybe friends, hanging out. I'd be crazy to get funny ideas in my head about him.

maybe I didn't know how Ashton didn't drive into a ditch when I started attempting to sing to some piece of opera that I was trying to learn on the spot. I sounded horrible and there was no way around it.

The asshole started to laugh.

My face was burning and I was sure I was going to try. I had no idea how I was going to possibly do this at competitions.

"Oh my God, I am so fucked."

He took enough pity on me to stop cackling like a hyena. "You're breathing wrong and that's why you sound like a banshee."

I gasped.

The mirth in his blue eyes made me feel even hotter. Like I was staring at the Caribbean under the midday sun. Or maybe I was just pissed.

I folded my arms and looked away. "Stop making fun of me. No one's perfect on their first try at something new."

"True, I was pretty shitty the first time I picked up a guitar." He paused. "Or a violin. Or a piano-"

I slowly turned my eyes back to him. "Just how many instruments can you play?"

"A few," he said vaguely, looking out to the traffic. "Let's try again. I promise I won't laugh this time."

I restarted the song on his phone and found the page with the lyrics again. At least it was in English and I wasn't attempting to sing something in Italian or French. I listened to the song on repeat a few times, trying my best to get a vibe for it. Most of the times, without realizing, I made up a story about each song I heard. If I liked the story, I felt compelled to be a part of it by singing it. It was easy to sing a lot of Latin party songs because they were all about having a good time, one way or another. And that was really all I wanted.

This was different. It was homework. I'd never had to force myself to sing. That, and the unfamiliar beats of classical instruments had thrown me for a loop completely.

Ashton could tell when I got burned out because he turned off the radio.

"Okay, what are you feeling right now?" he asked. When I had no reaction he glanced at me. "What?"

"That's honestly one of the weirdest questions I've been asked."

A rest stop came up ahead and he pulled into the exit. My eyebrows went up as he stopped and got out of the car. He walked around it and opened my door.

"Well?"

"What?" I asked him.

"Don't you want to stretch your legs?"

We'd only been on the road for an hour or so and it wasn't like I was dying of cramps, but a little fresh air couldn't hurt. I jumped out of the car and took a deep breath. The sun was high in the sky and so bright that I had to squeeze my eyes shut. It was pretty hot. A perfect day for the beach. Ashton walked over to a bench on the rest stop and climbed on it. I looked around, but we were alone and there was no one else to give us shit.



"Music is a feeling," he said suddenly, spreading his arms wide as he took a deep breath. "And feelings in turn can become music. Why do you think so many songs are about love?"

He dropped his arms and looked back at me. I looked down, realizing I was still in my cleaning maid uniform. A smile came to my face at how strange this weekend had turned.

"Come up here."

I looked up with a question in my eyes and he just motioned me toward the bench. I climbed it with some difficulty, and he grabbed my hand to help me. I brushed myself off and fixed my dress.

"What now?"

I looked ahead of me. A patch of green field was ahead of us until the eye could see. The noise from the highway hit us from behind, at odds with the chirps from birds overhead and the insects that we couldn't see among the grass. And then there was us in the middle.

He motioned all around us and asked, "What do you feel when you take in the moment? What's the song bubbling beneath the surface?"

A song immediately came up and I shook my head. "No, I refuse." He lifted his eyebrows. I looked down at my sneakers with scribbles on them. "Nope, it's embarrassing."

"More embarrassing than your performance in the car?"

I elbowed him in the ribs and he just chuckled. I rolled my eyes. "It's a Celine Dion song."

He whistled low. "I'd be pretty shocked if you can pull her off."

I looked away, pursing my lips and knowing I fell right for the trap. And so I started to sing fucking A New Day Has Come. And the pop version, to boot, to the backdrop of trucks and cars driving past at 70mph and facing a boy that wanted to laugh at me. But I sang like I was in front of a crowd in Las Vegas, with all the depths that I could possibly imitate from the original. The music in my head took over my body and it moved in tune to my words. I closed my eyes and imagined that it really was a new day, that I was brand new.

And then I got to the end of the song, to the part where it was all because of a boy.

My jaw hung open. I couldn't look at him as he slowly clapped.

"Now," he said, his voice charged with something I didn't care to decipher. "Try to remember that same feeling for our lesson. C'mon, we still have half an hour to go."

We got back into the car without making eye contact. He found the right song on his playlist and we continued practicing all the way until we drove past the sign saying Welcome to Sarasota.

I could tell that he didn't need the GPS to navigate his way around the city, just as I could tell that he was getting more and more tense with every ticking minute. I probably should have given him some words of encouragement or something, but I realized for the first time that I really had no idea what we were going to walk into. For all I knew, the bad blood between the brothers was so terrible that the other guy would pull a shotgun at the first sight of us. Hopefully not.

Ashton parked outside of a bar restaurant by the beach front called Flamingos and just sat there. Staring at the pink neon sign.

"Um." I looked all around. "Is this your aunt's place?"

"Yup," he said.

I opened my door. "Well, c'mon. This won't end until it starts."

The first smile in the past half hour drew on his face. "You're probably right."

He exited the car and we walked into the place. It was pretty nice, all made of wood planks that made you feel like you were walking under a pier. The crash of the waves mixed with soft music and the sound of the patrons' conversation. I somehow expected to see a clone of Ashton busying plates or menus back and forth, but none of the waiters looked anywhere like him.



We did find his aunt, though. I recognized the woman behind the bar as though I'd seen her before, because Jesus Almighty, those aristocratic genes were strong in the Winters family. But this woman was tanned, with laugh lines on her face and sun kissed gold highlights on her dark hair. She was all color, and not just because her clothes were straight out of the beach section at Target. It was just the impression she gave.

Her eyes were more like Ashton's than his own father's, and they lit up once she saw him.

She dropped the rag she'd been cleaning the bar with and ran over to tackle him with a big hug.

"My favorite nephew!"

I stifled a smile at how out of breath he seemed. Even though she was quite a lot smaller than he was, it seemed like she was strong.

She released him just to pull him down to her level by his cheeks. "Oh my, you've grown quite handsome since I last saw you."

He rolled his eyes. "I'm the same I was as when I visited last summer."

"No, not really. You're different." The way she said it was with a smile, but Ashton still looked like a bucket of cold water had poured over him. That was when she saw me. "Ohh... so that's why."

I put my palms up. "Um, it's not what you-"

"Ashton?"

We all turned to the new voice. I shivered, as though a spirit had just walked through me. It was kind of an out of body experience to be in the presence of two identical people, whose voices were nearly the same. They looked at each other, and if it weren't because of the different clothes I'd have wondered if there was a mirror in between them.

Ashton seemed to have the same struggle I did, but probably for different reasons. I couldn't imagine what it was like to always be around your own clone, to suddenly not have them by your side.

The life of a twin was an odd one.

"Ayrton."

I knew I was being rude but my eyes narrowed. What a strange name.

Their aunt clasped her hands together. "I guess we should all have cocktails to celebrate this wonderful family reunion." She laughed as the three of us stared. "Virgin cocktails for you three, of course."

Ayrton looked at me then. I noticed that his eyes were more on the grey side, like a storm cloud to Ashton's Caribbean ocean. Other than that it was hard to tell they weren't the same person.

But then the cheekiest smile curled his lips and showed all his teeth. "I remember you! The singing cleaning lady."

I snapped my fingers. "I knew you were the smart one."

He laughed and laced his arm around his brother's shoulder. "I like this one."

Ashton rolled his eyes but there was genuine relief all over his mug. I rolled my eyes to myself. He was the weird one. Whatever made him think his own flesh and blood would punch him in the face at first sight was crazy talk.

And then Ayrton stepped back, without dropping his smile. "What are you doing here?"

Ashton put his hands in his jean pockets and coiled his shoulders in a shrug he never got to release. "I came for you."

His brother leaned against the bar. In the background their aunt danced around the bar pouring things into a blender.

"You didn't have to, I'm not going back."

My eyes bounced back from one brother to the next. I figured that was my cue to make myself scarce, but then my phone rang. I pulled it out of my pocket and nearly collapsed.

The panic must have been blatant on my face, because they both looked at me with worry.

"It's my ma," I said. "I am so dead."

I knew things had gone too well.

As the phone rang my hands begun to tremble and my mouth begun a cursing fest all by itself.

"Code red," Ashton told his brother.

Cool like ice Ayrton nodded. "What's the alibi?"

Ashton caught my eye for a quick second as he looked around. He put two fingers in his mouth and whistled so loud that the entire establishment fell silent. All eyes were on him as he climbed onto a table.

"I apologize for the disturbance, ladies and gents, but we have an emergency on our hands."

He waited for a beat until he was sure he had everybody's attention but mine. My eyes had gone back to my cellphone's screen on time to see my ma's name disappear. This was even worse because not picking up right away meant I was not paying attention, which could be interpreted as I was up to something she wouldn't like.

"We need just a second of silence to bail our friend out from the wrath of an evil step mother."

Step mother?

To my surprise the murmur that ran through the tables was one of agreement. Ashton turned back to us and climbed out. He pulled his cellphone out and at the same time told his brother, "We need to pretend we're at music club practice."

My eyes widened. "My ma can sniff out a lie no matter how many miles are between us."

Ayrton smiled at me. "No worries, we're pros. Call her back."

Ash searched for something on his phone and gave me a thumbs up.

I called her back. My entire body was going through hot flashes as the phone rang.

Then Ashton stuck his phone close to mine, with loud symphonic music. Ma picked up right then.

"Vera Maria?"

The music stopped. But not in the sudden way of someone hitting pause. It stopped in a clash of instruments not being harmonized into a simultaneous end.

Ayrton cleared his throat and then his voice came out in a boom. "And just who said it was alright to take out their cellphone in the middle of practice?"

The haze of fear for my ma cleared up enough then that I could finally catch on. We were pretending to already be in practice. All around me people looked on in interest. I had to put a show for my sake.

I gasped. "Ma, I can't talk right now. I gotta go."

"Oh no, you won't. I asked you clearly for a text message when you arrived-"

Ayrton got in my face and said, "Go ahead, we'll just stop our entire practice so you can have your private conversation."

It wasn't hard to feign urgency. I really wanted the call to end. "Ma, I promise I'll call you back tonight. Bye!"



Then I hung up.

We all waited in silence as I looked down at my phone, half expecting that she'd call again. And she normally would, but she must have realized this time that she was gonna get me in trouble with school if she did, because the phone remained still.

"Yes!"

As I exclaimed this the twins gave each other high fives and a few of the customers started clapping. The background music came back on and when I turned I found their aunt fiddling with the sound system behind the bar.

"The trouble brothers are back, huh?" she said with a smile. "I bet you missed this."

Ayrton shrugged and didn't admit anything. "It was for a good cause."

I positively melted on a barstool. My heart was slowing down but that had been a lot more adrenaline than the weather report had forecasted for the weekend.

"Why don't you guys go out to the beach and talk for a bit?" their aunt said. "It'll take me a few minutes to cook up those virgin cocktails I promised and I'm a bit short staffed today."

The reluctance was clear on their faces, but Ashton was the one who followed the instructions and all but hauled his brother outside. After all, he'd come all this way for that purpose. I saw them go with more awe than I should have. I could just imagine them walking the halls of Trinity together, dropping jaws and panties, and boxers too, left and right. I finally understood why people cleared Ashton's way; no one wanted to stand next to such perfection and be found lesser.

I groaned to myself and put my hands on my face. It was burning hot even though I was in the shade. Just what was I doing here?

Their aunt stood before me with a smile. "I'm Jenina, by the way. But I hate that name, so you can call me Jem."

We shook hands. "Vera."

"Are you a friend of the boys?"

I shook my head. "No, it's kind of a strange story."

She leaned her elbows on the bar, eyes twinkling. "Oh, those are my favorite."

"I thought you were short staffed?" As I asked this I looked around and saw that there were many more waiters available than there were customers. My brow furrowed.

She shrugged one shoulder. "I had to get them by themselves somehow. Ayr's been moping around for weeks, waiting for his brother to find him but without doing anything at all to be found."

I rolled my eyes. "Boys."

Her laugh was hearty and true. "Tell me about it. These two are way more sensitive than they care to admit." She leaned forward. "But anyway, tell me your story as I make those drinks."

I told her my whole story. And I didn't even start by the part where I met Ayrton as I was cleaning his bathroom. I started from way back, from when I was that kid that people pointed to in the line and said, that one, the chubby girl. By the time I reached the part where I met Ashton, I'd already gone through one virgin piña colada and started on the second one, which might have been meant for one of the boys. But Jem didn't complain, she just made more drinks as she listened to me and punctuated her attention in all the right places. She gave me some stink eye at the parts where I told her that it was weird to hang out with such pretty people when I was just... the way I was.

"What do you mean by that?" She put her hands on her hips. "Girl, I wish I had lips like yours and hair with personality like yours. Not the limp noodles that hang on my head."

My jaw dropped. I looked at this beach queen. "But you're gorgeous and petite and so colorful."

"Thank you." She smiled. "But I also have cellulitis, stretch marks and not even humidity can make my hair develop some volume. Look," she put two virgin cocktails in front of me. "You need to learn to live and enjoy life in your own body, because it's unique to you and it's the reason why you can do all you can. I'm sure there's something special about it that makes you stand out and be you. Whether that's your hair or your hips, it doesn't matter. You should feel blessed to be who you are."



I grabbed my throat unconsciously. I felt like I'd waited my entire life to meet Jem and hear these words. I'd been living all my life under ma's criticism and Leti's well meaning, but mostly self centered words, and I was starved for someone to acknowledge me .

me "Promise me that you'll do that," she said, insisting.

I took a sip of my drink and nodded, eyes downcast so she wouldn't see that they were probably brimming with tears. "I'll try."

"Fake it till you make it." She slapped the bar counter. "Now, take these to the boys outside and check up on them."

"Okay."

With some difficulty I grabbed their drinks and mine and went outside. There were still a lot of people lounging in the beach mostly in their bathing suits, which made it easy for me to find the only two boys who were dressed head to toe sitting close to the chore. I waded in the sand avoiding toddlers and limbs of sunbathers. They both looked up at me and I handed them their drinks.

Ayrton was closest to me and he patted the sand next to him, so I joined him.

"Nice to officially meet you," he said. "Ash was telling me how you're basically the only friend he has now."

That earned him a smack to the back of his head from the other boy.

My jaw hung. This one was for sure the blunt one.

"Well, that's sad because we just met a week ago."

Wow, it'd only been one week since I started at Trinity. It felt much longer.

"That's not what matters. You can have friends for years only to realize that they weren't actually that," as Ayrton said this he shrugged. "And the other way around, too."

Ashton snorted. "True."

We all looked into the crashing waves as we sipped from the piña coladas. With the sun over me, the breeze, the sound of the waves and the smell of the salt, I felt like I was home. I'd gone back to Venezuela to visit a couple of times when I was very small, but the most vivid image of it in my mind was being at the beach with a bunch of relatives that I hadn't known until then. I'd felt a lot more acceptance from them, there at the beach, as they danced to music playing from a radio and I ate ice cream straight from a coconut shell, than I probably had in my entire life with ma.

I set my glass on the sand and took off my shoes and socks so that I could bury my toes in the warmth. The beach had a way to make me feel relaxed and a Latin song about it came to mind. I hummed it low in my throat.

"I see what you mean," Ayrton told his brother.

"Right?" Ashton asked.

I sat up straighter and looked at both of them. "Are you having a conversation telepathically?"

They smiled the same smile at the same time, thoroughly creeping me out.

"Fun fact, but you're replacing me in the orchestra," Ayrton surprised me by saying. "Trinity lucked out in finding you after I dropped out."

I looked from one to the other. Ashton had neglected to mention that piece of information.

Looking at him I asked, "Is that why you're so invested in teaching me?"

He shrugged. "Not really. You do need the help."

"You shut up." I threw one of my shoes at him. As their chuckles ebbed I asked, "So, did you two make up already?"

They exchanged a glance.

"It's not like I was mad," Ayrton said. "A bit hurt, maybe."

Ashton looked down at his drink and picked out the cherry. He dumped it in his brother's glass. "I'm sorry. I was a dick."

"Nah, not a dick. Just self entered." Ayrton leaned back on the sand on his elbows. "Although that's probably unfair of me to say. You'd just got dumped publicly at the same time as I came out."

My jaw dropped.

His eyebrows went up. "You didn't know?"

"Oh, I knew. That's pretty much all the school talks about but, was it all at the same time?"

"Same baseball game," Ayrton replied, looking at his brother. "Our school had just lost and for some reason Madison thought that was the perfect time to admit to Ash that she'd been cheating on him with our best friend, Quinn. Meanwhile I was in the middle of the stand making out with a cute boy I'd just met and someone posted pictures of us all over social media."

Wow.

Ashton squinted as he looked up at the bright sky. "Yeah, that was quite something."

"That part wasn't anywhere as bad as when mom and dad found out." Ayrton picked the cherry and ate it. "I thought I was going deaf from all their screaming."

That was unexpected. I'd have thought their dad would be all proper and never lose his temper. Or at least that was the impression I'd gotten.

"Was that why you ran away?" I asked him.

"Yeah," he trailed off the word for a while. "If I hadn't done that they probably would've kicked me out anyway. I'm a blight on the family name, to quote them."

I gasped.

"I'm sorry," Ashton said then as he played with his shoe laces. "I should've defended you."

"Then they'd have kicked you out too."

They looked at me as I slurped the last of my drink. "I guess I'm not the only one with a fucked up family dynamic, huh?"

They snorted. "Tell me about it."

♪ This Is Gonna Suck ♪ We made it back to school from Sarasota with enough time to beat the curfew, to find that the orchestra was already practicing. The plot twist here was that as soon as Ash and I ran into the music room I found that it was Sister Louisa who directed the orchestra. Saturday night and all Sunday was spent practicing a few religious songs for the recital. Those were fairly easy for me to sing because they didn't require great skill. In fact, I added a few touches here and there that I could tell made the Sister very happy.

Monday morning I woke up extra early so that I could catch up on all the homework I had neglected because of the crazy weekend. I was in the middle of it when the scrape of a chair being pushed back made me look up.

Madison Whatsherface sat in front of me, sweeping back her long blonde hair over a shoulder. Unexpected was to put this mildly. I couldn't shake off the impression anytime I was around that she was not pleased by my presence. I looked around. There was nobody else in the cafeteria. I didn't know if that was a good thing.

"Um, good morning," I said.

She rested her chin on a hand delicately. Her eyelashes were so long that they couldn't possibly be natural. "Everybody seems to be in love with you, the teachers, the nuns, Ashton."

Her expression was neutral as she said this, but a shiver racked my spine. As if my instincts were warning me that I was treading dangerous territory. I picked my cellphone up and looked at the time. I had a solid hour before the breakfast rush started. I couldn't waste it hearing someone talk crazy.

"Not to be rude but I really need to work on my homework."

"Oh, great. I should catch up with mine too." She pulled out a binder and a couple of notebooks and set them on my and Addy's table. As if this were totally normal. "My weekend was just so busy. I had to rush back to school for practice from Fisher Island, and I'd been intending on doing all of this on a yacht." She smiled at what was undoubtedly a stunned expression on my face. "Of course, that's nothing compared to your entire adventure with Ashton."

I hoped that by sustaining my silence she'd just drop it, but she leaned closer with a certain glint on her eye that made me feel trapped.

"How'd you know?" I asked.

"Oh, so there was an adventure? Are you guys dating now?"

"What? No." I lifted my palms up to form a defensive barrier. "How did you even-"

Madison ran her fingers through her hair, combing it to the side. It fell in perfect waves of spun gold and yep, that was me feeling jealous.

"Someone saw you come in with him. One thing you'll learn here is that there's no such a thing as a secret." Her glossy lips curled into an evil smile. "And gossip about the people at the top of the food chain spreads like wildfire."



I looked down at my notes and scratched my left elbow. Worrying my lip, I hoped no one had found out that my ma cleaned houses for a living. It was quite nice of her to give me this warning to cover my own tracks, really.

Her soft laughter twinkled. "You don't need to look so worried. That's why I'm talking with you now, when no one can see that I'm with you."

The way she said it made it sound like that kind of gossip would be bad for her image. I shot her a resting bitch face. "Are you done here?"

Madison started picking up her stuff, like she hadn't had any intention of studying in the first place. "I just thought I'd warn you to stay away from Ashton Winters. Hanging out with him is not what it's cracked up to be."

I batted my eyelashes as she stood up. "It can't be any worse than hanging out with cheaters, I suppose."

She froze. Her perfectly made up eyes looked murderous. "Careful. You don't want to alienate me, especially as I was trying to give you advice."

"Well, thanks for the advice. See you in class."

I pretended to focus on my text book until her steps faded away. From the corner of my eye I saw that she left the cafeteria and I breathed a sigh of relief.

It was easy to ignore her during class because I was just so busy trying to keep up, and at the same time ignore Ashton who kept tugging at my hair at random moments. He only stopped after I managed to sneak in a particularly vicious smack to his arm when the teachers weren't looking. But during music practice, my stand with the sheet music faced the violins directly. And when I caught Madison's eye I felt like I was in the presence of one of the malandros from the barrio. Like she could suddenly pull a knife on me like it was the most natural thing.

Music was hard. We had two hours of practice after class every day. Every break I had, I spent studying the books that Ashton had got me with music theory and the basics of reading music. But it wasn't enough to follow the rhythm of everybody else. We made a lot of pauses because I didn't know what to do, where Sister Louisa or Ash would come to help me. Every time I could feel my face burn with shame. I felt so bad that I was pulling everybody down to my level with me.

I was on the verge of tears when we finished practice on Wednesday. The recital was in three days and I was so, so not ready.

As Madison tucked her violin into her case, she clicked her tongue. "I knew it, with a singer this unexperienced we're all just going to waste our senior year."

My chin trembled as I saw her leave with her friends. Everybody was frustrated, but no one more so than me.

From above the noise of the kids leaving I heard Ashton call for Sister Louisa.

"Can Link and I stay with Vera to continue practice?"

I looked up in a flash.

"That'd be great." She smiled, looking as exhausted as I felt. "I'd love to stay and join but I'm afraid my feet are killing me."

"We'll be good, I promise." Link snorted at Ash's words. The latter raised his hands in peace. "For whatever my word's worth."

The nun nodded. "Very well, I'll send somebody up to check up on you every few minutes. Behave and remember to be in your rooms by curfew."

We saw her leave. I grabbed my sheet music and flung it to the floor. "Sorry to make you waste your time but I'm done."

Ashton rolled his eyes. "Look, you're not bad. You're just scared of music you're not used to."

"And it really sucks that you can't even read basic music," Link added from his piano.

I frowned at him. "I'm used to him giving me crap, but why are you here?"



He shrugged. "I had enough of him complaining every day and every night."

My eyebrows went up.

Ashton ran his hand through his silky auburn hair. "He's my roommate."

"I appreciate the help but you won't make me learn faster in three days."

"We are," Ash's eyes shone as he said this. "The class isn't working for you because it's pandering to people with experience. But I know just how you can learn."

"Hearing memory." The other boy said as he cracked his knuckles. "This idiot says yours is excellent."

Said idiot picked up my sheet music from the floor. "I'm going to sing and you're going to imitate."

I looked from one to the other. "Okay, I can try that."

Link said, "Just keep in mind that his vocal range is vastly different from yours. Imitate him, but using your own."

"Got it."

That actually went over okay. We got so into it that we almost didn't notice the time and ended up running to our rooms at breakneck speed. I got to mine panting and sweating like I'd just finished an olympic sprint.

A sandwich was pressed onto my hand as soon as I stepped into my room.

I looked up at Addy with tears in my eyes.

She shrugged. "I didn't see you over dinner so I figured practice ran long."

I flung my arms around her and squeezed her hard. After thanking her profusely and eating, I told her everything about practice, which segued into me giving her a demonstration. I only went to sleep when a teacher came to scold me for being noisy, and even then I couldn't sleep with all the music dancing in my head.

Thursday morning I woke up to a barrage of text messages from Ashton to get ready to meet him and Link for practice in the music room ASAP. There were a few texts from Leti sprinkled in between, but in the haze of panic that enveloped me I didn't pay attention to them. I jumped out of my bed, picked up all my stuff and ran into the bathroom, breaking a personal record with how quickly I washed and dressed. My hair was wet and soaked through the back of my shirt once I made it downstairs and found them prepping up their instruments.

Link warmed up in the piano and Ashton picked up his viola. There were no greetings exchanged, he just asked, "Ready?"

I took a deep breath and answered, "No, but here goes nothing."

I let my voice loose for two hours before class, then again after class, rinse and repeat on Friday.

Until Saturday finally came.

I saw the members of the orchestra file into the nicest school bus I'd ever seen, and felt like my feet were made of lead.

"C'mon," Ash said next to me. "It's time."

"I can't." I was sure I was trembling. "I'm way in over my head. I'm going to make a huge mistake and embarrass the whole school."

I felt hime take a deep breath. "No, you won't. You're ready for today. Every song is engrained in your head."

I turned to him and could feel that I was coming undone. "You don't get it. You're like, made for the spotlight." I motioned at him, up and down. "I'm a hack who has no idea what she's doing while pretending to be some sort of urban Disney princess."

He didn't say anything for what felt like a long time, just looked down at me as I hyperventilated. We both ignored Mr. Burlington as he asked us and a few other stragglers to board the bus. Ashton tilted his head and looked down all the way to my shoes and back up.

"Whoever made you feel like this is the real hack, because I've never met anyone more amazing." He startled me by holding my face and tilting it backward. For a second I felt like he was going to kiss me, but he used to motion just to look deep into my dark eyes. He sought for something in them, I didn't know what. "There's someone inside of you who is much greater than they, or any of us, can even imagine. Let her out, Vera."

I swallowed hard. My heart was beating hard in my ribcage to a rhythm that I couldn't decipher. I closed my eyes and pulled his hands away from my face.

"Okay, I'll try."

If only, because for the first time someone was hell bent determined that I was better than I was. I didn't want to let him down.

"Good, now come with me."

As he said this he tugged my hand to follow him into the bus. Every eye was on us as we walked down the aisle and sat together.

Well, he'd successfully chased away my panic. The problem was that he'd replaced it by an entirely different feeling that had no room in my life. I willed my heart to calm the fuck down and listen to reason.

We couldn't develop a crush on a rich gringo. That was just disaster waiting to happen.

♪ Betray and Disappoint ♪ The benefit for the children's hospital was held at a private venue. The Trinity kids were dressed in full uniforms, blazers and all, and even though all of them but me came from the rich spheres of the people that surrounded us, we stuck out like sore thumbs among the finely dressed people in attendance. Plus, the place itself looked straight out of a movie set and I just couldn't pick my jaw up from the floor.

We came in through a back door by the kitchens, so that we could carry our instruments and equipment in without disturbing the party. A couple of servers walked by me with trays of tiny food that was so perfect it looked plastic. All around me there was crystal, marble, velvet and swashes of champagne color. The whole space felt expensive.

Madison walked by me saying, "A fly's going to get in your mouth."

I snapped my jaw shut.

People ignored us for the most part as we set up, which gave me a false sense of security that they'd ignore us once we started playing too. Sister Louisa told me to stand by the piano and Lincoln joined me there. He looked at the instrument and nodded.

"Well, at least they brought me a good piano."

"How do you know?" I asked.

A corner of his lips lifted. "Near 18 years of experience."

I gave him a nasty look that he ignored. That was becoming a bit of a sore topic for me, my inexperience.

He pulled out his sheet music and arranged it in front of him. "Remember the order of the songs?"

"Yes." As I set up my stand to my height I added, "I hope."

The rest of the orchestra set up on the stage that had been prepared for us. With this configuration I was on the opposite end from Madison, which brought me some comfort. I stood between the piano and the rest of the orchestra, and had about five people between me and Ashton, which also made me feel pretty relieved. Being closer to him would've made me too nervous.

Sister Louisa made her way up and picked up the microphone that was meant for me. She faced the crowd and waited until she had their attention. This didn't take terribly long. It wasn't every day you were faced with a scene that looked straight out of The Sound of Music.

"In advance, we would like to thank you all for joining us tonight for this great cause," she started, to a modest round of applause. "As we entertain you with the music from the Holy Trinity High School Orchestra, we would like to ask you for your charitable donations to help the children in need that are fighting for their health." More applause that we all joined in. "And with that, please enjoy your evening."

She handed the microphone back to me and I felt bile rush up my throat as I set it back onto the stand. It was turned on, and the sounds of me fixing it in place echoed around the room. I turned it off and glared at it like it was my enemy. Or like it was a cockroach. Which was the same, really.



I couldn't do this.

I had to do this.

My lungs expanded as I drew in a deep breath after another. I caught Link's eye and he raised his eyebrows. A cough attracted my attention on the opposite end. I turned and found Ashton motioning for me to keep breathing in deeply. I did.

Sister Louisa raised her baton and conducted us to begin.

A moment of panic drew my mind into a blank, but the music started and I remembered that the first song was an easy one. The emphasis was on the instruments and not on the vocals. More of a melody meant for the background rather than a focal piece. It was an easy start for me then, because I didn't have to do a lot of effort aside from the accompanying verses. I looked out beyond the nun directing us and saw that hardly anybody was paying attention.

Great.

By the time the more vocal songs started I felt a lot more comfortable because nobody was focused on me. I could let myself loose and just sing. The sheet music in front of me was only helpful to keep me mindful of the lyrics, because I still couldn't read music for shit. I pretended like I was in my bedroom, all by myself, pretending that I was a princess in her castle singing to an audience made of friendly mice and little birds. I liked to pretend I was the first Latina Disney Princess and that this was a pivotal moment in my movie.

This fantasy kept me sane throughout the entire recital until the very last song. This one we hadn't had sufficient time to practice with the entire crew, but apparently it'd been one of the first songs the orchestra had played since freshman year. I was the only one who didn't know it, so we'd bypassed playing it over the week and instead Ash and Link had offered to teach it to me.

I pulled the sheet music for it to the foreground. It was a super sad song and it was kinda weird to me that we wanted to end on that note, especially when we were trying to gather money to save kids. But what did I know. Maybe the tactic was to tug at heartstrings so that rich gringos would shell out more money.

The orchestra started the music and I struggled a little bit with catching onto the beats. I caught Ashton's eye as he played his viola. He managed to mouth one, two, three.

And I begun singing.

Immediately every Trinity kid turned to me. No one stopped playing, but I could feel like something was wrong. I was sweating cold even as I continued to sing, wondering if I was off tune or if I'd messed up the lyrics somewhere. Sister Louisa's Mona Lisa smile fell for the first time since I'd met her, but she didn't acknowledge whatever was wrong.

I deepened my voice at parts and raised it at others, trying to convey the pain behind the lyrics. They were about loss. I didn't really know about that, much. I could say I was lacking a lot of things, but I'd never really lost anything, so singing this was a bit of a stretch for me. But I tried as best as I could. I gave it my all.

There was a big round of applause when we finished. I stood still, hands clasped behind my back and panting as the guests clapped. And clapped.

Over the commotion I heard Link say, "Well done."

Somehow I caught Madison's eye and I knew I was in trouble for reasons I couldn't begin to guess.

Sister Louisa turned to us with her placid smile. "Let's begin to pack up."

Some of the kids had an easier time picking up their equipment than others. I dismantled my stand and waited in the middle of the stage.

An older lady dressed in red approached me. "I don't know what song that was, dear, but that was beautiful."

I did the goldfish hat trick, mouth open, closed and eyes popping. "Thank you."

She was replaced by an older gentleman who just shook my hand. And then a middle aged couple who did seem to know the song, and expressed how unexpected it was to hear it in that setting. But that it'd been perfect.

My eyes narrowed. Something didn't add up.

I grabbed my sheet music and found the song. Hello , it was called.

Hello "That was incredible."

I startled as Ashton stood before me, his viola's case already hanging from his shoulder. I snatched his papers from his hand and flipped them until I found the last song. An unpronounceable name was on top of the page.

I looked up at him slowly and recognized the look on his face. He knew I was about to hit him.

"You were right, that was a pretty damn good arrangement," Link said as he joined us. Excellent timing, I thought, before smacking the shit out of both of them.

"You tricked me!"

Link froze with the shock of being hit, but Ashton ignored all that and put his hand on my mouth, trying to silence my shrieking. I bit his hand, and he jumped back, clutching it.

"Hey! That was not cool. I'm a musician, my hands are precious."

I stomped my foot on the floor. "Yeah, and I'm a scholarship student. Are you trying to get me kicked out?"

They exchanged a glance.

Ashton's eyebrows went up in that way that made him look like a puppy who'd just been kicked. "I just thought it'd be fun to put a touch of rock and roll on this."

Sister Louisa found us then. "Let's go, children. We have to board the bus and when we're back to the school, you'll follow me straight to the headmistress's office."

My eyes welled up right there and then. That had to show the two morons just how much fun I'd found their little stunt to be.

I sniffed, trying to not engage the water works in front of all these people.

"V, I'm sorry."

I swatted Ashton's hand away when he tried to touch me.

"Leave me alone."

There was something to be said about being stabbed in the back.

I managed to sit at the very back of the bus by myself. Maybe everybody was so pissed at me that I'd ruined their perfect little recital that they gave me a wide berth, because the entire back was empty. I got a few glares during the trip back to the school, but I avoided human interaction and just cried in as much silence as I could.

Wow, so, I didn't think that Lincoln and I were friends but I kinda thought that at least Ashton and I were, or some previous step to friendship. But friends didn't humiliate friends in front of other people like this. Friends were supposed to have your back, not drive a cold knife into it. I grabbed my phone and texted Leti for the first time in a few days.

I miss you . She didn't reply back right away.

I miss you God, just how was I going to survive music club by myself? I'd grown too dependent on help. It dawned on me then that I wouldn't even know how to begin getting myself up to speed without completely mucking up my studies. I was alone and in a world of trouble.

When we got to the school I was the very last one to leave the bus, but Sister Louisa waited for me with both boys flanking her. "Follow me," she said, and we did. Ashton tried to say something but she silenced him with a glance. She had us sit outside as she went in to see the headmistress and no doubt tell her everything about what we'd done.

I broke the silence. "If I get spelled I will find you and I will cut you."

Link side glanced at me. "Is that it? You'll cut us? I thought you were going to come up with a more colorful threat."

I glared at him with as much venom as I could manage.

"I never said where I'd cut you."

That made him cringe and look away.

I turned to the other boy. "Any sass from you, too?"

He looked up at the ceiling. "None."

The door opened and the Mother Superior asked us to come inside. We obeyed and followed the unwritten rule that if you were called to principal's for a dressing down, you had to stand. We did so, both boys around me.

Mother Superior Evangeline made her way slowly around the desk and sat down on her chair with some difficulty. The younger nun stood next to her, and I had a feeling she was a lot more pissed than her elder. But that didn't mean we weren't off the hook.

"I heard there was a bit of a situation at the event," the older lady started. She picked up her glasses from her desk and put them on, squinting at each of us. "Who masterminded this?"

My mouth remained firmly shut.

Ashton stepped forward. "Me."

Mother Superior drew in a deep breath and sighed. "Winters, we've talked about this. I put you in charge of her so that you could start learning some responsibility."



I couldn't help glaring at the back of his head.

The headmistress turned to the other boy. "And what about you?"

Link took so long to answer that I thought Sister Louisa must be plotting ways to get him to talk. But finally he sighed and crumbled under the pressure of their stare. "I was bored."

Her eyebrows went up. "Are we not challenging you enough?"

He had the wits to hold back answering that question.

But then she turned her laser focus on me. "And you, Vera?" I shook my head slightly, not knowing what to say. Would it work if I replied that I'd trusted two idiots? She sighed and it smarted that she was disappointed in me. How could I possibly have prevented this? "I hope you all understand what you've done. You've let down your classmates and your school, and this cannot happen again." She looked up over her shoulder. "Sister Louisa, what should be their punishment?"

I ran the palms of my hands down my skirt to wipe away the sweat. I was very worried about my fate, but at that second I was really plotting murder. There was a lot of land in the school where I could bury two bodies.

"We unfortunately can't suspend you because that would cause further hurt to the orchestra." Her chin went up. "Each of you will write an essay of 1,500 words about the importance of the collective and the perils of individualism. I want you to use today's experience to help you understand why sometimes doing things your way causes more harm than good."

That was it?

I wisely remained silent, though.

"And I want it by tomorrow at breakfast."

I pursed my lips. Of course there was a catch. It wasn't the worst punishment but it certainly wasn't easy. I couldn't churn out that many words with little time. I glanced at the clock on the wall and figured I had a couple of hours before dinner when I could make a decent head start, and maybe finish it in my room overnight.

The headmistress nodded. "You're dismissed."

The three of us left her office. Once the door was closed behind us, Ashton tried some shit again and I raised my palm. I made that sound ma always made when she wanted to stop me on my tracks, that sounded like a very dry and nasal ah ah . It shut his lips sealed.

ah ah "I don't want to hear it."

He looked away. "I was just going to say that the music room must be empty right now, we could go there to write our essays."

Link nodded. "Good idea."

"You do that, I'll go somewhere else."

They both stopped and looked at me. Ashton sighed. "Are you going to stay mad forever?"

I laughed, but it was an ironic one. "You white boys don't understand just how long a Latina can hold a grudge."

Link smirked. "I'm yellow, though."

I gave him a wide eyed stare. "And yet you're just as bad as him, why's that?"

"Okay, V," Ashton said, "I admit it was wrong of me to trick you and I promise I will never do it again. From now I'l stick to the program."

I threw my hands up in the air. "So you say, but how can I trust you?" I snapped my fingers when he didn't reply. "This is all my fault. I was told you were a troublemaker and to stay away from you by many people, but I didn't listen."

Link looked at him. "She's not lying, though."

Ashton elbowed him in the ribs. "Whose side are you on?"



"My own," the other boy said. "I mean, it was fun and all but I'd like to stay out of trouble in general."

"Now you're going to turn on me, too?" Pretty boy rolled his eyes and huffed. "You play the piano in this school just so you can get into a good music program in college, but meanwhile you compose EDM music and post it on Spotify. You're seriously not gonna tell me that you're fine with one more year of playing mindless religious music."

My jaw dropped. This was a brand new development that I hadn't seen coming.

I pointed at Link. "EDM? How?"

He sighed and pushed his hair behind his ears. "I have a ton of equipment in my room, okay?"

"Look," Ashton continued, "All I'm saying is that we're wasting our talents here, just following instructions."

"Oh, no. No, no," I said as I backed away from him, shaking my index finger. "I'm starting to recognize the pattern and I know exactly what you're doing. You're trying to stir shit again."

Ashton pursed his lips and jammed his hands in his pockets. "Okay, I'll confess something to you both." The other boy and I exchanged a glance. Pretty boy tucked his tongue against his cheek for a second and then said, "I think we should form a rock band."

Something strange bubbled in my chest and it came out as laughter. So much of it, in fact, that they both struggled to shut me up. After a minute I managed to calm down and swatted their hands away from my mouth with promises of biting them.

"You're off your rockers," I told him, giggling at the pun.

"Listen to me," he said. It struck me that Link hadn't outright told him to fuck off and instead listened attentively. Ashton motioned between all of us. "There's more talent in our pinky toes than the music school in this program can handle. Link," he said as he turned to the boy. "I've heard your music. It's no joke. That's why you have millions of followers and you're not even 18 yet or have a label contract."

I jumped. "Millions?"

"And you." He turned to me, running a hand through his hair and biting his lower lip. "You astound me."

My mouth opened. He smiled a little.

"Imagine what it would be like if the rest of the world could see what I see and hear what I hear." Since that left me at a total loss for words, he looked at the other boy again. "We have different talents but a shared passion for music. Why is this idea so outrageous?"

"Gee, I don't know," Link started. "Maybe because we're in a freaking boarding school ran by nuns? You really think they'll like it if we form a band to play devil music?"

Ashton smirked. "There's Christian rock, you know?"

Link rolled his sharp eyes. "And you, Ashton Winters, little devil that you are, are going to play Christian rock?"

The subject of the question positively beamed. "Hell no."

I snorted, and this brought their attention back to me. This was the most ridiculous conversation I'd ever engaged in in my life.

"I have a very long essay to write and don't have time for this, so, bye."

I figured I'd camp at the library to work on this. It was in the same building as the music room but posed a sufficient distance between us.

But they followed me there and sat across from me.

"I'm intrigued," Link whispered. "But there are so many logistical issues that I can't see how this could possibly work."



We'd grabbed sheets of paper and pens from the entrance of the library that I intended to put to good use, but they were distracting me.

I shushed them but they continued.

"Like what?" Ashton asked, as low as his voice could go while still being audible. But a few people glared at our table anyway.

"For one, we don't have enough people. Vera can sing, I can play the guitar and you can play something else, but we're missing some more depth."

Ashton snorted. "You, play the guitar? You're deluded. That's my specialty."

I rolled my eyes so hard it almost gave me a headache. "Oh my God, are you seriously fighting about who gets to play guitar in your fantasy band? Go away!"

That earned us a shush from the librarian.

We put our heads down and I thought that was that, but then Link spoke again. "You just want to play lead guitar so all the girls look at you."

Ashton gifted him a dry, deadpan stare. "I play a strings instrument in the orchestra. What do you think I'm best at?"

Link shrugged. "You could be bass."

"Fuck bass, I play guitar. Period."

I gave them both my best resting bitch face, straight out of the pages of my ma's Book of Pissed. "Why don't you both duel it out and leave me alone?"

Ashton smacked his hand on the table. "Excellent idea."

The librarian appeared next to us in a flash. "I'm going to have to ask you to leave if you can't be silent."

Ashton stood up, ignoring her and her rules. He stared down at Link. "Consider the gauntlet thrown at you."

Slowly Link stood up and got all up in the other boy's grill. "Challenge accepted."

"Let's do this."

"Yeah, right now."

I looked from one to the other. I didn't know if this was the effect of pride, testosterone, or both, but it was clear to me at that point that they were both idiots of the same pod and that I was better off on my own. And yet I found myself picking up our papers and pens and following them to the music room.

"Are you serious about this?" I asked them.

"Dead. Serious," Ashton enunciated.

There was an entire wall at the back of the music room with cabinets full of instruments. I sat at the front line of where the orchestra would practice, watching as they pulled out two guitars from the cabinets. They looked like the kind you had to plug in to play.

They came forward carrying two weird boxes that looked a little like radios but didn't seem to be. That was what they plugged the guitars into.

Link did something to the strings of his guitar as he looked at the other boy. "How do you want to do this?"

Ashton smirked like a cocksure little bastard. "If you have to ask you've already lost."

He ran his hands through the strings of his guitar and the sound made me jump from my skin. It wasn't overly loud, but something about it set me alight. He put his foot on top of the little box and just let it go. Whatever he was playing was so familiar to him that he didn't even have to look down at his hands on the strings. He just kept a defiant look fixed on Lincoln. The second boy narrowed his eyes to slits.

Before I noticed, he'd picked up the notes from Ashton and started playing, too. Even though I didn't know the songs I could tell that he was segueing into a completely different one. He was good, too.

My jaw dropped. Was every freaking kid in this school some sort of music prodigy?

Ashton didn't allow him much time for glory. He cut in right away with a different song that almost made it seem like he hadn't been playing the same instrument as the previous one. Somehow he made his guitar produce a completely different sound, graver, not something I'd ever heard before. He did something weird to the strings that it almost sounded like he was destroying it, shredding it to pieces.

I could tell Link was bothered, because he launched into a series of rapid sounds that were supposed to intimidate the shit out of his opponent. They sure rendered me speechless. But Ashton picked right up and played even faster.

"Oh my God," I said under my breath. No one heard me, of course. It was too loud and crazy.

He stopped abruptly, eyes lost on something outside the door. I jumped to my feet, expecting an angry nun, what I saw instead made even me uncomfortable.

Madison and her beau, Quinn, stood holding hands and looking at us.

She smiled and strode inside, pulling at the other boy inside as well. "That kind of mad playing could only be you."

I turned back to Ashton. His face looked like stone. Link just shrugged at me.

"What are you doing here?"

I'd never heard that kind of ice in his voice. When I thought about it, it made him sound like a younger version of his father. I looked around me and figured to my great sadness that if I wanted to walk away from whatever shitstorm was about to whip up, I'd have to leave right through the eye of it because I was right between Ashton, the approaching couple and the exit door.

"Were you the one responsible for that last song?" she asked, motioning at me. "I doubt the newbie over there has the skills to arrange the vocals of one song on top of another."

Ashton must have decided that his best course of action there was to ignore her. He turned toward Link. "Well, I think I'm the clear winner."

In turn, Link must have decided to play along. He bent down to unplug his guitar. "Fine, I admit you're only a bit better."

"A bit?" Ashton asked with a laugh. "I swept the floor with your ass."

I smiled to myself. He kinda had.

From the corner of my eye I saw Madison fold her arms and cock her hip, obviously annoyed that she was not the center of attention. I made eye contact with Quinn, and it was super weird. I'd never exchanged a word with him but I could see it clear as crystal that he wanted to be anywhere but there.

"Are you going to ignore me?" she asked. "Because I come in peace."

Ashton snapped then. "Nothing about you is peaceful. You're a headache."

She pretended to look hurt with a delicate hand on her chest. "Really? Is this what I get for trying to be friends?"

"We'll never be friends again."

Ashton grabbed the box with one hand and his guitar with the other. He turned away and headed to the cabinets.

"Right," I muttered. "I'm just gonna take my leave. I have a lot of things to do."

That was a stupid move because it drew her attention to me.

"Was it fun? Completely screwing up our first recital?"

I imitated her hand to chest move. "Wow, is this really your version of coming in peace?"

To everybody's surprise Quinn snorted a laugh. When his girlfriend glared at him he just said, "What? That was a good one."



Ashton was done putting his instruments away and head back over, hands in pockets.

"Impressive, so she hasn't finished brainwashing you quite yet," he said.

Quinn intercepted him on his way out with his palms up. "Wait, man. I just want to talk."

Ashton smiled but it didn't reach his eyes. "Too bad we don't always get what we want, huh?" He tried bypassing the other boy, whose reflexes were just too good and reacted fast enough to keep blocking him. Pretty boy sighed.

Lincoln came back from putting his guitar away too and tugged my arm to sit back down. He joined me and whispered, "Let's just sit back and enjoy the show."

I whispered back, "Got any popcorn?" This earned me a smile.

"I've been trying to apologize for months, man, but you keep ignoring me," Quinn said. He had a similar puppy look as Ashton. Hard to resist by anybody except each other, it seemed. I wondered if they'd learned it from each other when they were friends.

"Ever thought it might be because I don't want to hear what you have to say?" Ashton countered.

Madison stepped behind him. Every possible exit he had was blocked. It was like they'd planned it. Well, if there any blood was drawn Link and I would serve as witnesses, except I really didn't want to be in any more trouble with the headmistress. In a way, Madison had been right. Being around Ash was just calling for trouble.

"Are rich kids always so dramatic?" I asked Link because, gee, they were starting to make my friends back home look innocent.

He shrugged and folded his arms. "Sometimes it's worse."

"Dude," Quinn started. "We've been friends since freshman year. Can we not throw that away?"

Ashton shrugged. "Should've thought about that before you started sleeping with my girlfriend."

I gasped. The three of them looked at me, as if remembering that we were still there.

I looked at Madison with wide eyes. "You naughty little-"

She waved a hand as if setting my words aside. "Not your business."

Sure, but they were airing her business in front of me.

Quinn picked up then, looking down at his sneakers. "And I'm sorry, man. It just happened and it was wrong, but I really like her."

"Yeah, I did, too."

My heart broke a little bit for Ashton because if I'd been so hurt by his and Link's little prank that I'd cried during an entire bus ride, I could only imagine what he'd felt like when he found out about all of this. And in front of the entire damn school. No wonder he'd been a mess after this and the whole episode with Ayrton.

"I miss you," Quinn said, going for the jugular. "I miss how the three of us used to be, always hanging out together and having fun."

The other girl stepped up next to her boyfriend, facing her former friend. "I miss us too, Ashton. I can't believe how aloof you've become."

Oh my God, I rolled my eyes. Why did she make it sound like the whole mess was his fault?

"Kay." I slapped my hands on my knees and stood. "I think I've had enough drama for today."

Ashton narrowed his eyes at me. I didn't know how this fact registered in my mind even as I tried to walk away. He was faster and in two quick strides grabbed me by the arm and pulled me against him. I felt his arm come around my shoulders and hold me firmly against him.



I looked up at him with something like creeping horror. Then I saw both Madison's and Quinn's faces, awash in confusion. But it was Link's the one that sent me into a panic. He looked like he was on the verge of laughter.

"Guess what?" Ashton asked, and I felt his voice vibrate in his rib cage against me. "I'm done missing you. I've found someone better."

Madison tossed her perfect hair back with a laugh. "Is this a joke or are you talking about her? "

her? "Oh, yeah. I'm talking about her."

"Huh?" I asked.

I'd grown used to being the smartest student in my class at my previous school. Perfect A+ for three years and the person in my family with the best prospects at going to a decent college. At that second I felt like I was missing a few fingers on my forehead, because I had no idea what was going on.

Ash walked around and stopped in front of me. I blinked up at him. I probably had a neon WTF sign on top of my head.

He grabbed my cheek and bent down.

And kissed me. Right there and then.

I stilled.

The pieces of the puzzle started to connect. I remembered the morning where Madison had come to warn me about hanging out with Ashton. It had been strange and unsolicited. Like it'd gain something for her more than for me.

She'd been jealous that her ex was hanging out around another girl. She still cared what he did and with whom. And for some reason she didn't want him to do anything with me.

Link had known what was coming. It had been written all over his face. He knew that somehow shit was going to hit the fan and it was going to spray all over me. Because he knew that Ashton had the touch of the stomach; everything he touched turned to shit and like a dumbfuck I'd been close enough to him to be sprayed.

And then there was Ashton.

He still cared about Madison enough to do something as crazy as kissing me just to make her blood boil.

So, knowing all of this, why did I feel like melting against him? Why did my body react to the movement of his lips against mine, as if any of this were real?

Sure as shit it wasn't, but I was enjoying it. So I played along with being played. My hand rested between us on his chest and I felt his heart beat hard beneath my palm. It must have taken some guts to pay his ex back in a similar way to what she'd done.

But he was using me. Again.

This had to stop.

The sound our lips made when I pulled away was almost like we'd been engaged in a make out session that we both wanted. I kept my eyes closed for a second longer as I licked my lips and felt they were swollen. I didn't want to face whatever was going to happen after this. So I turned away from them and looked down at my trembling hands. I wrung them together and took a deep breath.

Then I turned back to find all eyes on me. I swallowed hard and plastered a smile on my face, showing my dimples. It was the same one ma had trained me for whenever there were customers around. Good morning, sorry, excuse me. Polite. Impersonal. Vacant. Submissive.

"Well, that's certainly the end of this party for me. Have fun."

I dodged Ashton's hand as it reached to me.

"V, wait."

I didn't wait. I dashed out of the music room with as much speed as my pudgy little legs could produce. I heard steps behind me but I didn't look back. I kept running forward until I made it into my room. Addy was out this weekend, so I had the room all to myself. Which was both exactly what I needed and at the same time, totally not.

I sank onto the floor with my back to the door. I touched my lips.

"Jesus, what just happened."

I couldn't keep this locked in my chest. So I caved and called Leti. I'd avoided telling her much about Ashton, but after this she deserved to know everything so she could scream at me for involving myself in rich people schemes. And that was exactly what she did when I told her the whole story. It made me feel a whole lot better for the entire five minutes she used in order to mentarme la madre, but one hour later when we hung up, I realized I was going to have to face him again in class and at practice.

And I didn't know how I was going to do that after he'd used me for his own amusement twice in a single day.

♪ I'm Definitely Not Okay (I Promise) ♪

School was for studying, not for fooling around.

I decided to live by that rule from that Saturday night on.

I finished my essay and handed it to Sister Luisa before breakfast the next day. I snatched a bunch of food from the breakfast buffet while it was still so early that the cafeteria was mostly empty. Hopefully it'd be enough for the rest of the day because I had no plans of leaving my bedroom. That way I minimized my chances of running into Ashton and company and could focus entirely on my homework.

Thank goodness for calculus, history and literature. I put on headphones and listened to old school merengue and salsa as I worked. It kept me sane for the rest of the day.

When Addy arrived to our room from her weekend away she found me hacking away on my old laptop as I finished up an essay for AP Lit. She brought in two suitcases that were so big I had a hard time imagining where all the stuff was going to fit. Our shared desk was pretty large but it was taken up by her sewing machine and supplies. Plus, any shelf space that could be found was to the brink with fashion magazines, scraps of fabric and a shocking number of buttons. She saw me eye the suitcases with concern and cringed.

"Okay, I think it's fair for me to make a bit more of an effort to be a better roommate." She walked back outside and came in carrying the biggest pizza box I'd ever seen. "I hope this helps repay you for the bother?"

I set my laptop aside and jumped to my feet, almost panting like a dog. "Are there any pineapples in there?"

"Ew, no."

I jumped at the box. "Thank God."

We sat together on my bed as we worked on the box together. Then she asked the million dollar question.

"How was your weekend?"

I swallowed a cheesy bite and looked her dead in the eye. "Do you really want to know?"

She tossed her strawberry blonde hair back and away from her slice. "Of course."

The whole sordid story spilled out of my mouth like a bad case of hangover puke. I'd spent the better part of my day immersed in schoolwork and trying not to think about anything, but the feelings started to bubble to the surface as Addy gasped in turns, scowled or cursed.

At the end of the story I whined, "You warned me and I didn't listen, I know."

She smacked my leg. "I wasn't about to say I told you so, I'm not gloating about this." She fell silent as I munched on the crust of my slice first. "Well, the worst part is that you'll have to deal with them in class and at practice."

"You're telling me."

"What are you going to do?" she asked me.

I shrugged. "My best friend Leti says I shouldn't let them treat me this way and she suggests swift revenge."



Her eyebrows went up.

I smiled a little. "For your information, I'm ignoring her advice. I think the best thing I can do is avoid them."

Addy leaned back against the wall and stretched out her legs. They fell off the bed in uncomfortable looking angles. She was tall and big, and the individual size beds must be a pain in the neck for her.

"That's probably the best you can do. Once they see that you're not responding to their fuckery anymore they'll grow bored and find somebody else to mess with."

I thought about it. That was probably true. The rich gringo kids seemed to live their lives hard and fast, with a rhythm the rest of us poor mortals couldn't entertain. Addy was right, they were probably going to get bored with me soon.

"Thanks, Addy."

"Any time."

My phone chimed in the silence and I paid attention to it for the first time in hours. I picked it up from among my books and papers and looked at the screen. An entire reel of missed phone calls and texts greeted me. A couple from ma, Leti, one text from DeAndre. But the most common name on the screen was Ashton, all phone calls except for a single text.

I'm sorry .

I'm sorry I pursed my lips. In the short time I'd come to know him, I was beginning to understand that he often put himself in the position of having to say that sentence. I wondered if it really meant anything at all coming from him.

Addy looked at it from above my shoulder and whistled.

"Girl, this may prove to be a challenge."

I sighed as I set out to reply to everybody but him. "I hope not," I said.

Of course, the next day was a disaster. I managed to make it to first period without any Ashton sightings but as soon as class started he was behind me, tugging my hair and passing notes that I kept dumping on the floor. I hoped for a teacher to notice this and reprimand him, but he was a sneaky bastard and didn't let himself get caught.

During one period change he stood up and so did I, at the same time. We faced each other off. When he opened his pretty mouth to say something I cut him off and said, "Excuse me, I need to go to the restroom."

He was wise to not block my way, but the short exchange still caught the eye of everybody in class. They followed me as I left the classroom and I could almost feel them still on me as I locked myself in a bathroom stall. I was mad that my skin got goosebumps when he looked down at me, and that my eyes had gone straight to his lips as though I had any right over them. Dios mío, I hadn't even been this thirsty when I'd gone to the pool with my friends over the summer and seen DeAndre shirtless.

I put my face in my hands. Somehow I had to control myself.

I finished my business and washed my hands and my face. I walked out of the bathroom thinking that I'd better kill the five minutes left until next period outside of the classroom, to see if that helped me regain my sanity. Then I caught Quinn coming out of the boy's bathroom and made the mistake of making eye contact with him.

"Hi," he said, walking over as he dried his hands with a paper towel. "You're Vera, right?"

I gave him a tight smile. "Nice to meet you."

He tossed the towel in a nearby bin. "You don't seem to mean it."

I sighed and ran my fingers through my mass of hair to straighten it for lack of anything better to do.

"Look, I don't personally have anything against you, it's just I'd rather not get involved."

He gave this vibe of being a good guy, which made it harder to super impose the image of an unscrupulous guy who'd stab his best friend in the back by, what was it, sleeping with said friend's girlfriend. That wasn't the kind of stuff good people did, and as a general rule I tried not to hang out with bad apples, whether they be poor like the guys in my barrio, or rich like this guy.

He folded his arms and looked down at his shoes. "It seems to me you're plenty involved already. Are you and Ash dating?"

"What?" Was this guy on crack? How could he possibly ask something that outrageous.

His eyebrows went up. "He kissed you."

"Oh," I said. Then I waved my hand. "No, we're not dating. I don't even know why he did that. I guess I was just standing at the wrong place at the wrong time."

"I don't buy that." He looked over my head for a moment, as if thinking, and then back to me. "I don't think Ash would grab just anyone and kiss them to make a point. I think he likes you."

I clasped my hands. "Fun talk, but I don't want to be late for class. Bye."

Quinn followed me, because of course we were going to the same classroom anyway. "Don't get me wrong, at first I thought it was all a show he put so that Madison would get pissed, and I think it worked because that kiss sure looked real to me."

I gritted my teeth and tightened my fists. "It wasn't. Please stop talking about it and focus on why your girlfriend would get pissed instead and leave me out of it."

He sighed and muttered, "You're probably right. I just wish things were different."

I'd been honest when I told him I didn't have anything against him, but at the same time I didn't have a lot of sympathy for him. I looked up at him over my shoulder. "Wishing and doing aren't the same. If you want things to be different you'll have to accept one of two outcomes."

"What are those?" he asked, with hope lighting up his face.

I held one finger up, "One, that it'll be a steep climb to earn his forgiveness and two," I said as I held another finger up, "That it might never happen."

Quinn looked pained. "You're probably right."

"And either case doesn't really involve me," I said for good emphasis.

I was also probably in for deep shit somehow. Ashton's and Madison's eyes followed us as we walked into the classroom together and I had a feeling it was going to be a very long week.

♪ Sugar, I'm Going Down ♪

I was usually right when it came to foreseeing bad shit.

The next morning I woke up early as usual and headed to the girls bathroom in my floor. I wouldn't say I was a morning person, in truth, but it wasn't often that I woke up and was already tired. I guessed it was the prospect of another weird day with Ashton's eyes boring holes on the back of my head.

I found my favorite shower stall and cranked the hot water up. I put all my clothes into a locker and stepped under the hot stream with a sigh. I kneaded my shoulders hoping it would ease the tension off of me, but I knew that this wouldn't be enough to help me deal with a bad boy. A laugh startled out of me. Somehow, despite drowning in music every day, I had forgotten that it was precisely music what always got me out of a funk, and my brain was ready to serve me with just what I needed.

Taking advantage of the perfect echo of the shower stall, I lifted my voice into as good an impression of Olga Tañón as I could serve. She was one of ma's and my favorites. She'd never said so but I always had a feeling that Olga's was the voice she had tried to imitate on stage, just as she tried to emulate Selena's charisma.

"Muchacho, muchacho, muchacho malo, haz hecho de mi lo que tú has querido," I started singing to myself as I soaped up. "Tan solo con verte me descontrolo, con solo un roce yo me derrito."

I refused to accept the truth in the lyrics and kept jamming. This extended my usual shower time but when I stepped out of it I felt refreshed and ready to face whatever crap came my way that day.

And of course, I realized pretty quick that I spoke too soon.

My towel was gone and so were my clothes.

I rubbed my eyes, refusing to believe this. Maybe the hot water had fogged my vision. But when I opened them again I saw that yep, hook and locker were empty. I checked the other nearby lockers to see if I'd put my clothes in a different one from the usual, but they were all empty.

That was when I started to panic. I was wet, naked and far enough from my room that a walk back to it would be terrifying. Plus, I didn't think it'd go well if a nun saw me like this. If anyone saw me naked, period.

My heart started to beat at a trot. This could get me expelled!

"Hello?" I called out, hoping to hear a maniacal cackle at least, so that I could find the culprit and punch them in the face. I tried to cover myself as best as I could with my hands and hair as I walked around, trying to find anybody. I was on the verge of tears now. Who would do something so heinous?

"Is anybody there?" I stopped just on the door, hoping that the prankster would be standing outside and would take pity on the fear in my voice. "Can you please return my clothes?" I smacked the door hard. It wasn't fair that I had to beg when I was the one who was wronged.



Only silence greeted me, though.

I looked at the clock on the wall and began hyperventilating. Most people would start to wake up and come into the bathroom soon. I couldn't just stand and wait to be found on my birthday suit like a freaking pervert. I was full on sobbing when I figured that the bully was not going to spare me any more humiliation.

I took a deep breath and pushed the door open with my shoulder. I poked my head out and looked at each side of the hall. It appeared empty. Without thinking any further I ran to my bedroom and locked the door behind me.

Addy had been in the middle of folding her towel into her toiletries basket and nearly jumped out of her skin at my appearance. With eyes bulging out she asked, "What the hell?"

I just let out the ugliest wail out of my chest. She jumped into action and wrapped me with her own towel. Between sobs I told her what had happened and she drew in a sharp breath.

"That bitch," she said, as if she knew exactly who was behind this. I looked up at her and she shook her head. "This has Madison written all over it."

"What?"

Her face flushed with anger. "Okay, story time."

She spoke as I tried calm myself down and got dressed.

"You can probably tell, but I love clothes." She motioned around our room at her mess. "Making them, that is. I can't help but look at people and envision exactly what I'd make for them, what would bring out their best features and make them feel more comfortable with themselves. Well," she said, and folded her arms. I wiped the tears off of my face with her towel. I could tell this was a sore topic by the way her entire face pinched. "This one time at the end of freshman year, Madison caught me checking her out. In my head I was thinking that she'd look really nice in a dress with an empire waist. In her mind, she thought I was sexually into her."

My jaw unhinged.

Addy rolled her eyes. "I'm all about love is love, but first of all if I were a lesbian she's not a person I'd go for. She's too skinny for my taste and she has a black hole where her heart should be. Anyway, I guess she felt embarrassed and in her mind that gave her license to start telling all the girls in our floor to watch out for me."

"That's horrible."

"My friends back then told me not to worry, that they'd have my back, but the abuse started mounting."

My chin trembled and I bit my lip. "Oh, Addy. I'm sorry. Did your friends turn on you?"

She flashed a grin. "No, they graduated."

"Oh."

"After that, when I was all alone, she did the same thing to me that she just did to you." Her brow's fell and darkened her entire face. "Well, it was a bit different. I caught two of her minions in the middle of stealing my clothes and gave them a good pummeling."

"Did they leave you alone after that?" I asked.

She shrugged. "They did. Literally nobody else wanted to get remotely close to the girl who beat up the popular queens."

I hugged myself. "What should I do? Resort to violence, too?"

Addy scratched her head and looked down at me, pensive. "Probably. But hey, at least you got me and I got your back."

She walked behind me like a bodyguard once we finally made our way down for breakfast. Neither of us had any makeup to hide how haggard my eyes looked after I'd cried like a baby. If I thought yesterday had sucked, today was much worse and it was only getting started.



A few people looked our way as we made it to our table. Shit started to get weird when it seemed like every person who filed into the cafeteria looked at us. At me, to be precise.

"It feels like everybody knows," I muttered to Addy.

She couldn't even deny it for the sake of my comfort, because even she was startled by all the attention.

In a plot twist that none of us saw coming, Lincoln plopped his tray on our table, pulled up a chair and sat. He showed us one of those anonymous apps where messages can only be seen if you're close enough to the OP and read a message.

"Senior scholarship student V was seen streaking naked across the hall this morning. A bet gone wrong or ghetto customs?"

I drew in a sharp breath. It felt like I was being stabbed by every eye on me.

"Ohh," Addy said under her breath. "She is so dead."

Lincoln put his phone away. "At least there are no pictures."

My grip on the table turned into a vice. "What are you doing here?"

He shrugged. "You need numbers behind you. Besides, we'll be bandmates soon."

"I'm sorry, but did someone bludgeon you over the head this morning?"

"That'd be me," a new but familiar voice said. Ashton put his tray next to mine and joined our table. He lifted his palms up as I glared. "Look, I know you're still mad at me but you need all the help you can get right now."

I folded my arms. He was right, but he was an idiot if he didn't realize that he was trying to be the cure to the sickness he caused.

"This is all your fault, the last thing I need is for you to be close to me and stoke her fire."

"Her fire?" Ashton's eyebrows went up as he opened his bottle of orange juice. "So you know who it is?"

Addy rolled her eyes. "Duh, your ex. Who else could it possibly be?"

He rubbed his chin. "Madison wouldn't do something like this. She's not an idiot."

"Oh, really?" my friend asked him, narrowing her eyes in what looked like a threat. "Because she did the same to me in freshman year, or did you conveniently forget?"

His eyes darkened in return. "No, I didn't forget. But that wasn't Madison."

"Look, defending your ex right now is not making you seem like a good guy at all," Lincoln said, to my surprise voicing my own thoughts.

Ashton took a chug of his juice and then sighed. "It was Belle and Natasha, right?" Addy's body stiffened and he nodded. "They were the ones who pranked you. They got suspended for a week."

"So what?" Addy asked, pointing at him with her fork and then looking back at the table full of queen bees. "They acted on orders."

Pretty boy leaned back on his chair and also looked out at the table where his ex sat. He nodded to himself, as if coming to a decision.

"You know what? You may be right. I might have been blind to the real Madison for years." His lips took a mean turn. "I mean, clearly she's not as nice as she seems."

He stood up suddenly, making all of us jump in our skins.

In dawning realization I saw him march over to their table. I got on my feet and caught up to him.

"Ashton Winters, what are you doing?"

He didn't look at me but said, "Standing up for ourselves."

I grabbed his arm and tried to hold him back. "Stop, you're only going to bring me more trouble."

But he was stronger and what ended up happening was that he dragged me all the way to their table.

"Madison, we need to talk."

All the queen bees turned to us and I had the certainty that I was screwed.

The top queen bee looked from Ashton to me, back and forth a couple of times.

"Never mind," I said, chickening out even as I felt like grabbing her hair and smashing her perfect face on the table. "We were just leaving."

Ashton shook his arm off my hold and bent down to lean on their table. He looked at each girl in turn and finally rested his eyes on Madison.

"Is it true?" he asked.

She tilted her head. It sent her long golden hair into a cascade over her shoulder.

I fidgeted with my hands and looked around and cringed. Even if I ran away now the whole school would have already seen me in the middle of the mess.

"Is what true?" she asked.

Ashton's voice lowered and it gave me a shudder. "That you stole away Vera's clothes this morning?"

The girl's eyes widened to an almost impossible extent. Mine did, too. Not only because Ashton's voice sounded like he was capable of committing murder, but because he also had just outed me as the idiot who streaked this morning.

I slammed my elbow onto his side. "Gee, thanks for telling everybody that it was me!"

He grabbed his side in pain and looked at me with his entire face scrunched up. "I'm trying to help you."

"As usual, I really can't tell if you're helping me or making me sink deeper."

Madison stood up and I jumped. I'd almost forgotten that she was there. She looked me up and down, not with hostility but with pity. And I didn't know which was worse.

"Look, aside from reading the message that half of the school has read, I have no idea what you're talking about." Then she looked at her ex. "And frankly I'm offended that you'd think I was the person behind the prank. What do you think I am?"

Oh, I didn't know, a cheater? Cheaters had no regard for other people's feelings. Plus, the fact that she'd seemed so upset that Ashton kissed me made her a prime suspect for revenge.

A new voice joined us. Addy. "I don't know, the jealous ex? Not to mention, you had your minions, Thing 1 and Thing 2 over there do the same thing to me years ago." Said minions gasped in outrage.

Madison threw her hands up in the air. "I never asked them to do that!" When it was crystal clear that we didn't believe her she turned to her friends who looked down.

Thing 1 said, "Sorry." And she and her other friends looked genuinely like they were hoping Earth would swallow them whole.

I exchanged a glance with Addy. Her jaw was as unhinged as mine. I figured it was probably more shocking for her, after having gone for years resenting them over the episode.



Madison tossed her hair over her shoulder and folded her arms. She honestly looked hurt. "Why do you all keep assuming the worst of me?"

I could feel a headache forming on my temples, and we hadn't even started class yet.

"Wait," I said, lifting a hand up and drawing the attention to me. I didn't recoil from it this time. "If it wasn't you, then, who was responsible?"

We all started looking around, as if we'd be able to see a giant neon arrow pointing at the culprit. But life was never that easy, so-

And then I saw them, two girls a few tables away. They jumped out of their seats, grabbed their bags and ran away as though we'd sniffed the truth out of them. They passed Quinn who was entering the cafeteria. He stood there stunned and as confused as everybody else, until Ashton screamed at him.

"Q, run after them!"

Without questioning why, Quinn turned around and ran out of the cafeteria like the devil was after him. I found myself following suit. After a few moments, between my huffs and puffs, I looked around me and found that I wasn't alone. Addy and Ashton flanked me, Lincoln had joined us and to my shock, so had the five queen bees. But there was no time to wonder what the fuck was going on as we followed the trail of Quinn chasing the two girls all the way to the lake outside. I thought for a second that he was going to tackle them, but he just grabbed them by their shirts and forced them to stop if they didn't want the clothes to be ripped off of their back.

I caught up to them last, panting so much that the act of standing was the only thing I could do. It'd have been worse if Ashton didn't have me running on the treadmill every day.

He was actually the first one to recover. Ashton got all up in their grill as Quinn held them captive by their shirts. Now that my brain wasn't rattling inside my skull and I could see them up close, I recognized them. They were part of the orchestra. I didn't know their names but I knew they weren't seniors.

"You must have ran because you're guilty."

They just glared at him.

Addy took a step closer to them. I didn't know if it was her reputation or her size what made them shrink.

"Why did you do that to my friend?"

I couldn't believe it when they just scoffed and admitted everything.

"She's so annoying," the one of the right side.

The other one added, "Everybody's fawning over her and treating her like some sort of genius, and she can't even learn the music without two boys helping her everyday."

I just looked around me to see if everybody was hearing the same thing I was. These two girls were jealous about me? About me having the attention of two boys?

I absolutely lost my shit then and started laughing. Everybody looked at me, no doubt getting to the same conclusion I just had.

"Ah, this is the most absurd thing I've seen in my life." I shook my head as I kept laughing. "What is it, are you jealous of people treating me nice or about me hanging out with boys?"

They didn't reply to my question, just glared.

Link snorted. "Imagine if they'd seen you kiss Ashton."

A second later he was howling in pain, since I stepped on his foot with all my strength.

I walked to the girls and asked them, "Did you take pictures?"

The first one rolled her eyes. "Of course not, we're not stupid."

"Then give me back my clothes, apologize and get over yourselves."

They looked away, refusing to acknowledge my request. I looked back at the others, raising my hands as if in question. If you asked me, it wasn't a ridiculous request. What I really wanted to do was knock their heads against each other and drag them to the headmistress's. This was much better and I hoped that if they saw I wasn't a total bitch they'd just leave me alone.

Quinn had apparently put two and two together at that point and shook them a bit. "I guess since they won't apologize the only thing we can do is take them to the Mother Superior."

"No, please," the first one of them broke. "We won't do it again."

"And?" Ashton asked, folding his arms. I could tell they had trouble looking at him, and at me, when they muttered shitty apologies.

"You're not seriously going to let them go after they humiliated Vera, are you?" Addy asked us, incredulous. "What they did was a serious offense. They should be expelled."

"I agree," I said, viciously enjoying the panic on their faces. "But I'll be straight up. Everybody here knows what they did. If they try something else any of us will be able to run and tell."

Madison smiled at me. Which was a first.

"And by letting them go, they'll be in your debt," she said. "Clever."

"Thank you?" I asked, because I wasn't sure anything coming from her to me was ever a compliment.

"Christina Brownstone and Jackeline DiMarco." The two girls paled as Lincoln said what I assumed were their names. Then he recited two addresses and smiled. "We know where to find you."

Quinn let them go and they scrambled away. I saw a bunch of people peering at our group from the windows and doors leading outside. But then I looked back at Link.

"How did you know their addresses?"

He smirked. "I Googled them while you all were playing good cop bad cop."

Addy put her hands on her hips, radiating displeasure with every breath. "I don't think you did the right thing."

To everybody's shock, Madison sauntered over to me and gave me a friendly pat on my shoulder.

"Welcome to Trinity." She then snapped her fingers at her girls and said, "Let's go, we'll be late to class."

I made contact with Addy and the boys, willing them to explain to me all that had just happened.

Ashton bumped his arm against mine as we headed back into the building. "Told you we'd help."

Lincoln and Quinn high fived me.

By the time we made it into the classroom we were all grinning like we shared a secret.

It felt almost like... we were friends.

♪ I Just Wanna Leave ♪

By the time the weekend approached I'd had enough of this crazy place. I filled in the weekend leave request form and submitted it to Sister Louisa, who finally didn't seem mad at me any longer.

Somehow the streaking incident hadn't made it to the teachers' ears and I was counting my blessings. Miracles existed, and I knew it.

Ma picked me up early Saturday morning and I promised to myself I wasn't even going to be mad if she made me clean houses all weekend long. But instead she drove me all the way home. She was wearing her maid uniform, which meant she had to go to a job, but I didn't dare to ask her if she wanted me to help and shoot myself in the foot that way.

But she read my mind.

"All my girls are reporting to work today," she said, unprompted. "So, don't worry. I'll just drop you off at home. You can do your homework and babysit Victor for me."

That caught my attention. "Babysit him? Why?"

"Your dad is going to be out until tomorrow."

I hated it when she referred to the gringo as my dad. He wasn't, by a long shot. He hadn't even given me his last name. And I didn't think dads were supposed to creep you out.

I refused to ask why, but she felt the need to fill me in on more details. "He's got a job outside of town this weekend."

We got off a main road and into a narrow street that led into our barrio. The houses turned more and more shabby as we drove deeper into the street. The gringo was a professional welder and he worked on and off for a contractor company that did a lot of different jobs. Anywhere from buildings construction, to oil pipes, big and small equipment manufacture.

I could tell this weekend was going to be bomb because he wasn't going to be around for most of it.

My grin was wide and bright as I waved my ma goodbye. I wheeled my suitcase into the living room and wasn't even fazed by the chaos that my little shit of a brother had amassed in the living room. He gave out the loudest fart a little five year old body could create and I thought that was a fitting welcome coming from him.

"Dios Santo," I gagged. "Did you just crap your pants?"

He giggled and I picked him up. It did smell like he'd soiled himself so I hauled him into the bath. A few moments later he was splashing in the bathtub. I sat next to him to keep watch and called Leti to let her know the news, but I guessed she was still asleep because she didn't pick up.

I nearly gave myself a heart attack when the bathroom door opened and the gringo looked down at us. He rubbed his nose and sniffed before he pointed at me.

"Get out, I need to piss."

The man that charmed my ma, ladies and gentlemen.

I didn't protest at all, though. I got up and waited outside until he was done and came out. Without a word, I slipped back into the bathroom and sat next to my brother again. Because having a conversation with a hyper and incoherent five year old was a lot better than a second in the gringo's presence. I breathed a sigh of relief when I heard the front door close and his truck start. As he drove away I felt my mood lift higher.



Leti called me then. When I picked up she greeted me with a, "What's up, perra? I thought you'd forgot about me."

I laughed. "How could I possibly. Guess what?"

"What?"

"I'm right across the street."

She hung up and a couple of minutes later she was barging in. We squealed once we saw each other and met each other halfway, wrapping our arms around each other.

"I swear you look so many shades whiter," she told me. "Are they feeding you caviar at your fancy boarding school?"

I rolled my eyes. "Stop. They serve pizza and pasta just the same."

We sprawled on the couch in the living room as a now clean Victor sat on the floor to watch cartoons.

"Okay, but you need to tell me everything about that place." She leaned closer to me, eyes wide. "Better yet, got pictures?"

I knew this would happen eventually, so I'd managed to sneak a few pictures of the school here and there. Leti was impressed, but nowhere near as much as I'd have expected.

Here was the reason. "Cool and all, but got any pictures of the people? Especially that guy who kissed you."

That caught me in the middle of drinking some apple juice and I choked. The juice came out of my nose, and oh, it was painful.

Even though she was grossed out she found me some napkins in the kitchen. I glared at her as I cleaned myself up.

"Of course not. That'd probably get me in trouble."

"There's something called a selfie, you know. You walk up to someone and ask them to take one." As I continued to death stare her she changed tactic. "What about Facebook?"

"I guess we could," I said. I had to admit I was kinda curious to see what her reaction would be once she saw Ashton and company. They all were a sight for sore eyes.

I pulled out my phone and set out to stalk people on Facebook. I found Quinn first, and we spent a good twenty minutes or so going over his profile. Leti was salivating.

"What about DeAndre?" I asked her, laughing my ass off.

She snapped her fingers and shook her head. "Well, do you see him around?"

We both lost our shit once we found a shirtless picture of Quinn. Boy was ripped. You could wash your clothes off his abs.

An unexpected name appeared on my screen as the phone vibrated. I was so startled that I dropped it on the floor.

Leti picked it up and looked at it. Her dark eyes gleamed with something that made me nervous. "Isn't this the pretty boy? Let's see what he wants." Then she picked up the call and put it on loudspeaker. "Hey papacito lindo, how you doin'?"

I could've died. "Oh my God, Leti!"

There was silence for a second longer. Then his voice, "Vera?"

I snatched the phone away from her. She was nearly in tears of laughter.

"I'm sorry," I said to the phone. "My best friend knows no bounds."

He chuckled. "Best kind of people, if you ask me."

"Hell yeah," Leti said. I swore the apocalypse would happen if they both came together against me.

"So, what are you up to?" he asked.

After the craziness of the week, I'd decided to give him the benefit of the doubt and got on friendly terms with him again. But this call was still unexpected.



"Um, nothing much. Just at home."

"Great, because I'm outside."

Leti stopped laughing and looked at me. I looked back at her. We both looked at the phone.

"What?"

Honking came from outside.

Leti scrambled to the window and parted the curtains. I saw the white Jeep parked outside by the curb.

So many thoughts raced through my head, but the first one I acted on was to turn off the call. I stalked outside of the house and walked over to his car. I was about to scream bloody murder when he rolled down the window and I saw that he was not alone. The strangest group greeted me. Lincoln sat in the passenger's seat. Addy and Ayrton were on the back.

"What the hell are you all doing here? How did you know where I live?"

Addy raised her hand. "I found it on your welcome packet. You kinda left it laying around our room."

I folded my arms. That was true.

"Yeah, but who told you to come unannounced?"

"I just announced it over the phone though," Ashton said, giving me sass.

I pursed my lips and told myself to turn the anger down a few notches. Ayrton opened his door and stepped out of the car, looking around. He smiled. "I like this place."

I gasped and looked around. Taking in the small houses with unkept yards, chainlink fences and beat up cars parked across the street. I'd been to his place and I knew there was no comparison to be had. Yet, his smile was genuine. Like he could possibly feel more at home here than in his fancy mansion of seven rooms.

"Hi, I'm Leti," my best friend said, shaking his hand. "Are you Ashton?"

"Ayrton," he said. "The younger, gay twin brother."

A weird sound snapped me to attention. "Oh shit," I said, and turned to run back into the house. I found Victor crying on the floor.

"I tried to hug Peppa," he said as he pointed at the overturned TV on the floor.

A few moments later the entire group followed me inside. I had a second of embarrassment at them seeing where I came from, but had to suck it up quickly so that I could make Victor stop crying.

"Are you on like, babysitting duty?" Link asked. He looked ganglier in regular black clothes than he did in his uniform. I nodded at him and he clicked his tongue. "I guess you won't be able to join us for the concert, then."

That was when I noticed the common theme. All of them were wearing mostly black. Black jeans, tees and accessories. As if they were headed to a casual Friday funeral.

I frowned and looked at Leti, but she was as confused.

"What concert?"

Ashton jammed his hands in the pockets of his impossibly tight jeans. I tried not to look at his thighs. His blue eyes were shining as I looked back up. "I thought you could join us for a rock concert in town. It could be educational."

I snorted. "Are you really going on with that crazy idea of yours of forming a rock band?"

"Yep. I'll convince you somehow."

"Wait," Leti said, drawing their attention to her. "You want Vera to be in your rock band?" She looked at all of them and started laughing. She pointed at me. "She's never even heard one rock song in her life."

I rolled my eyes. "I've heard one." The one Ashton taught me on a treadmill, but that was it.

"Exactly," Link added. "Which is why she needs a crash course. And this concert is pretty awesome. One tribute band after another."

I gave them the most condescending smile I could as I glanced down at my brother, who was hooked back up on Peppa Pig.

"Sorry, I can't."

"Oh no, chica. I'm not missing this for the world." We all looked at Leti. She motioned at me. "Pack some of Victor's stuff. We're taking him to Nana and my mama. And then we're going to this concert."

"We?" I asked her, eyes wide as saucers.

"And you know what? I'm calling DeAndre. This will be hilarious."

I opened and closed my mouth repeatedly. When it was clear I wasn't moving a finger, she did the packing herself and pushed my brother and I to her house. It was the strangest thing to introduce my kind of friends from the new school to Leti's family.

kind of That was when I slammed on the breaks.

"Sorry, guys. I can't. Ma will kill me if I don't stay put-"

Nana winked at me. "Leave Victoria to me, go have fun and take care of my grand daughter."

I knew ma wouldn't dare to lose her shit at an elder, but that she'd for sure lose it at me after everything was said and done. Yet, I still found myself in the back of Ashton's Jeep with Addy and the boys. Ayrton had joined Leti in DeAndre's car, and all seven of us drove to this concert.

And I had to admit, I was excited.

♪ Everyday Is Not Exactly The Same ♪

The venue was in some obscure street off of OBT. The area was packed with cars and we ended up parking a couple of blocks away in the back of a strip club. I had a hard time wrapping my head around how things had escalated to this level, but at that point I just thought the entire thing was hilarious and a by-product of hanging out with the Winters brothers.

The younger twin walked up to the bouncer with a spring on his step. I didn't think he meant to go in, especially when considering the fact that he was not interested in any female parts, so I looked at Ashton for some sort of intel. He shrugged.

"Hey there, sexy," Ayrton said with the confidence of someone who, for some reason, doesn't think he might just get beat up. The bouncer, a huge bald man with bulging arms, looked down at the pretty boy.

"ID," the man said.

Ayr waved that away. "I'm not going in. I just wanted to know if it's okay to leave our cars parked out back here."

The man folded his arms and his muscles bunched. "No. Parking's only for customers."

Undeterred, the boy picked up his wallet and produced a green bill. I couldn't see the denomination from where I stood, but I did see the way the bouncer's eyes bulged instead. He looked around and snatched the bill.

"Have a good day," he said.

Ayrton turned to us with a grin. "Let's go, friends."

Leti linked her arm with mine. "Rich people are something else."

I snorted. She had only the gist of it.

As we approached the place, I started to see more and more people parade in the same direction. They all looked like they belonged to a music video.

"Fascinating," Addy said, eyeing them. "You'd think that only wearing black would get boring, but look at all the creativity around us."

I tried not to stare, but it was hard not to when the guy in front of you had a spiky mohawk that seemed to reach the sky. I wondered how he got his hair so stiff and pointy or if someone helped him. A silver claw jumped out of his left ear's tunnel and his other ear was pierced by bobby pins. Jesucristo.

Just off the side was a girl wearing what looked like a wedding dress all in black. Her hair was adorned by red roses and her arms and chest by tattoos. She held hands with another girl who wore cargo pants and a t-shirt with a logo I assumed belonged to a band. I looked at my group, all in jeans and t-shirts with bands, except for Leti and I who just settled for nondescript clothes from Target, and DeAndre who wore an Orlando Magic t-shirt.

My lips twitched and I told Addy, "Meanwhile look at us, we're like the casual Friday funeral gang."

She snapped her fingers. "That'd be a great name for your band. Guys, what do you think?"



Ashton and Lincoln joined us from behind and I felt an arm drape around my shoulders. I startled and looked up to Ashton's profile. He grinned down at me.

I heard Leti loudly say get it girl , but it was hard to react to anything other than his blue eyes so close to mine and his lips curved up in mirth. Lips I knew the taste of.

get it girl "What was that?" he asked. His deep voice embraced me and sent my nerves tingling, and I had to do a superhuman effort to extricate myself from his trance.

I took a deep breath and looked away, and still my lungs filled in with his cologne. I stepped out of his hold and smacked him, hoping it all looked friendly and not like I'd just been about to snatch him away into an empty alley and tear into his clothes.

"Nothing," I said. My voice was up a few notes. "I just said we look like we're going to a casual Friday funeral."

He turned around to look at Link. I tried to seek refuge in my closest girl friend, but Addy surprised me by joining the boys in talking about how that could be turned into a brand. I made eye contact with Leti but what I saw in her eyes terrified me. She was on the verge of teasing me until kingdom come. The last safe refuge was DeAndre, so I snuck up to him.

"I feel kinda sorry that Leti forced you into this."

"Don't sweat it, chica. It definitely makes for a different Saturday." He smiled and lit up his entire face. I finally saw the venue in sight, its front wallpapered in posters and crammed with people. DeAndre cleared his throat and I looked back at him. "So, um. You and the white boy?"

"No way." I shook my head so much my head spun. It was definitely about that, and not at all about the question.

"For real? That looked a tad possessive to me." He jerked his thumb backward, to where I'd been standing with them before.

"We're just friends, kinda."

"Kinda," he repeated, raising his eyebrows.

"Okay, guys." Link called to everybody's attention. Once he had it he asked, "Who's paying for the tickets?"

I'd never seen twins in action until then. In unison, Ashton and Ayrton chirped, "You are."

I just laughed as realization dawned on Link that he shouldn't even have asked the question. He grumbled what I was sure had to be curses in Korean, but still marched over to the ticket booth and got in line. He ended up paying for all seven of our tickets. I was going to be nice and buy him a drink when we got inside, but at seeing the prices for a single soda I decided he'd made his bed and had to lie in it.

The place was half full and we found a spot halfway to the stage but the gig hadn't started yet. The stage was ready with a drum set and a few other instruments, but they were blaring some weird rock music with electronic sounds in between. It was loud enough that we couldn't hear each other scream, which I figured was how the concert would be. It wasn't dim enough yet, so I pulled up my ticket to see which bands were playing. I didn't know a single one, of course, but I counted six of them. I hoped the whole thing was done and I was home before ma arrived.

As more people came in we were squeezed closer to the front. An older guy with long, gray hair walked into the stage and picked up the microphone.

"Welcome everybody to this year's battle of the tributes!" The crowd roared and my body grew paralyzed.

Real talk, I'd never been in a concert before. Not one like this. I'd seen my ma on shows when I was a toddler. I remembered the cheers and the people singing along, but it hadn't been like this. Pure euphoria from a mass of people who loved one thing in common, in sound form. I felt like the only unfamiliar thing drowning in the feeling.

"Let's welcome our first band on stage," the man continued. "They are called Nevermind Nirvana, straight up from Mobile, Alabama. Let's hear it for them!"

People clapped and whistled as the band took to the stage. They were three guys who looked like they'd been plucked from a Trader Joe's or something, not on par with the audience. But once they started playing they made the whole place vibrate.

In their enthusiasm, people crushed us forward. I yelped as I felt a hand against my butt and was going to turn and glare when someone pulled me by the arm. My alarm ebbed away when I saw that it was just Ashton, pulling me away from whomever. He tucked me against him, my back to his chest, and said something into my ear.

I wasn't sure what it was, because it was pretty damn loud, but I could've sworn he said he'd keep me safe.

After that I couldn't concentrate on the music the band was playing. It seemed like my body was too busy producing music of its own. I stood stiff and uncomfortable even as everybody around me seemed to bounce, but I didn't move away. Not because there was nowhere to go. But because I didn't want to. I thought of Quinn telling me he was sure his former friend had a thing for me, and of DeAndre earlier, casting doubt on whether we were just friends.

But something was certain to me. There was no way a boy like Ashton liked me. There was no way he, with his arms around me, couldn't feel the muffin top around my waist that no diet could get rid of and still find me attractive.

There was no way.

A sharp elbow in my ribs made me look up and catch Leti winking at me.

I turned away to face the band on stage. The guitarist jumped so high that he was probably a gymnast. And the crowd exploded in excitement. Ashton let me go and hollered.

I shook my head to myself. Leti, DeAndre and Quinn were all wrong.

The first band finished and they turned on the weird electronic rock in the venue. The crush of people relaxed and I felt like I was able to breathe again when I had enough space to get away from Ashton. It had grown hot and humid and I was sweating everywhere. I didn't dare to look at him and see if there was a Vera shaped wet spot in the front of his clothes.

"Phews," Leti half screamed. "That was pretty intense."

"You don't say," Addy piped in. "And that was just a cover band."

"Yeah, but what you don't know is that these are the best cover bands in the country right now." Link had our attention as he explained, that today was the final of a year long competition that engaged bands from all over the country, and today the champion cover band was going to be chosen. "I'm going to be pretty disappointed if anybody but the Queen cover wins."

"What's their name?" I asked.

He grinned. "Yas Queen."

Ayrton laughed. "What are they? A gayer version of the original?"

"You'll see."

That colored me intrigued.

Leti slid up to me. "Your friends are pretty interesting."

"They're not my-" but I didn't finish that sentence. I looked as Ayrton teased DeAndre about something, and as Ash, Link and Addy were engaged in conversation as though there hadn't been years of barely talking to each other between them, and I realized that well, I didn't hang out with anybody else at school. And when they weren't giving me sass, they were pretty nice to me. So I guessed it wasn't a wild stretch of the imagination to say they were my friends.

Ashton's eyes shifted to me and I looked away.

Except him. It was stranger with him.

"Yeah, I guess," I told Leti at last.

"That was amazing," the older guy said back in the microphone suddenly, drawing our attention back to him. "But we have a lot left in store for you all. Up next, let's welcome these guys from Seattle, Washington. They're called Effervescent."

Ashton gasped so loud that we all looked at him.

"Vera, you gotta see these guys."

I was about to tell him that yes, I was short, but I could still see them. But all that died in my lips when he grabbed my hand and led me through the throngs of people all the way up to the front. I stood by the barrier and felt him slide behind me. I turned with difficulty and glared.

"Why did you bring me out front? Do you want me to die crushed by everybody?"

His eyes were wide and fixed on the band members as they walked up stage. But he still replied, "Don't worry, I won't let that happen." His eyes shifted down to me. "These are the guys I brought you to see."



I turned back to them and the only thing I found remarkable was that there was a girl among them.

"Why?" I asked him.

But then the first notes of a song I recognized came up and I froze. When the girl grabbed the mic and started singing, I felt a shiver run through my spine. I felt the tension coiling Ashton's muscles tight against my frame, and at that second I didn't have to guess why. It wasn't because of the crowd. It was because of the music. That electricity coming out of the band was passing through to us and I felt my body respond to the call. My mouth opened and the lyrics poured out of me. Ashton's body and mine moved together as if taken by the music. I felt his voice vibrate against me as he sang along to the man's lyrics.

It was like we were submerged in our own concert.

It was like my blood was running through my veins for the first time.

I thought the singer was looking at me as we sang the last few notes together. It felt like she was challenging me.

The roar around us was deafening once the song ended, but I ignored that and pivoted to look at my companion. My eyes were wide as I looked up at his grin. It was wide and fierce. Predatory, even.

With my heart racing I told him, "I can do it better."

"I know." He leaned his forehead against mine. His eyes burned me. "And I can give this to you. All of it. The crowd, the music, the magic. You just have to want it, too."

The next song started. I didn't know it, so I couldn't sing it along. Without ever having heard the original, I knew I could sing it better than the girl on stage. I knew I could put more emotion into it. More intensity. More.

By the time this band was done and we were able to find the rest of the group again, I was positively bouncing. This feeling. This precisely, was what my ma had chased all her youth. It was what I craved and never felt myself worthy. Ashton thought I was. He wanted to give this to me. And at that second, between screeching guitars and the swaying crowd, I wanted him to.

I lost track of time as one tribute band after another appeared on stage. Yas Queen really was the best. Even the most brown people in the place, Leti, DeAndre and I knew a lot of Queen songs that we could sing along to. But without being an expert I could tell that these guys had a domain on their instruments that went beyond just imitating. It was a shame they didn't have their own songs.

They won the contest by a landslide, and when we finally made it outside Link gloated about it.

"Well, at least I didn't waste having to pay for seven tickets for that."

I looked down at my hands in the glow of the afternoon sunshine. They were shaking. My breath was coming out shallow and rushed, as if I'd ran.

"I feel the same way, too," Ashton said out of the blue. We all looked at him like he'd grown crazy. But his eyes were on me and I felt a zap of electricity between us. My skin crawled into goosebumps. He gave me the wolfish grin again. "I know just what can take the edge off."

DeAndre took a step forward. "Just wait a second, Vera's a clean girl."

My eyebrows crashed into a frown and it took me a second to figure out what he was talking about. I nearly jumped out of my skin.

"No, DeAndre. He's not talking about drugs!" I stopped waving my hands in defense and narrowed my eyes at Ashton. "Right?"

He touched his chest. "I'm wounded." His Caribbean blue eyes rolled. "But definitely not. I have something way better in mind."

Sex? But I didn't say this because there were so many people coming out of the venue at the same time that we had to get out of the way, so we started heading back to the strip club. Which was the weirdest thing I'd done all year, in what the past couple of months had already proved to be the quirkiest of my short 17 years so far. I ended up bundled back into the Jeep, and Ashton drove without a peep of where the destination was. DeAndre followed behind us and I felt relieved that whatever it was, at least he'd have my back.



All questions vanished once we parked, got out of the cars and saw a gigantic neon sign that read karaoke.

I whirled toward the evil twin. "Really?"

The good twin, the one who didn't give me crap all the freaking time, clapped a couple of times. "This is a great idea! We used to come here all the time with Madison and Quinn, didn't we?"

Ashton ignored that. He folded his arms and lifted his chin, looking me dead in the eye. "I challenge you to give me a better show than those bands."

Leti cleared her throat but I knew how perverted her mind was and chose to ignore her. It was the best way I could devise to not end up embarrassing myself in front of everybody.

I lifted my eyebrows and imitated his stance. "Oh yeah? What's in it for me?"

The corner of his lips lifted. "A whole night of rough, hot-"

I punched him in the shoulder at the same time as I, very loudly, said, "DeAndre, can you please take me home?"

DeAndre's eyes shot daggers as he pulled out his car keys, but I was distracted by Ashton's laughter. "Okay, okay. How about I make your homework for a week?"

Addy snorted. "V's a way better student than you are, why would she do that?"

"V?" Leti asked me, hearing the nickname for the first time. I just shrugged.

"Good point," Ashton said as he rubbed his nape. He looked around for help and when no one gave him any suggestions, he said, "I'll owe you one?"

I looked off in thought. That could be interesting. I smiled a little at the glimmer of fear in his eyes.

"Anything?" I asked.

He swallowed hard. "Deal?"

I tried to give him the same evil smile he'd given me earlier as I grabbed his hand and shook it. "Deal."

As we walked into the karaoke bar I had a thought that these rich kids probably had better stuff to do with their lives on a Saturday night. While I was supposed to stay at home in my barrio, doing homework and babysitting the insatiable ball of energy and malignant gas that was my little brother, I was sure there was some fancy gala in town or some sort of wild party with famous DJs off of a nearby island that they skipping. Instead we were all together at a dinghy karaoke bar, in the middle of nowhere in Orlando, too far removed from anything fun to capture tourists, and too in the middle of the mundane life to even attract the locals.

Ayrton ran to the stage and grabbed the microphone. He tested that it was on and looked around him with a wide smile. It was just us, the bartender and a waiter.

"Alright everybody let's get some hype going on." He hooted and hollered and only Leti joined in for the fun of it. "We're gathered here together for our very own battle of the greats. On one corner we have Ashton W, king of broken hearts and loud farts."

We lost it at that and cracked up laughing. It was even better when said king bent down and pulled out a shoe that he threw at his brother with shocking accuracy, socking him in straight in the money maker. The resulting yelp only made me laugh more.

When Ayrton recovered he pointed to me. "On the other corner we have Vera With A Very Long Name, queen of curls and sass because, yas, girl." I bowed to the attending applause, not even bothering to hide my amusement. Ayr continued, "Who is going to be our first contender?"

At that moment the waiter walked up to us. He looked nearly bored to tears.

"Y'all can have your fun if you buy something."



Link didn't seem to be a person who could let a chance go past him, and he shot his shot. "One round of beers for everybody."

The waiter deflected said shot easily. "Good try. One round of cokes coming. Do you want to start a tab?"

Link groaned. "Aw, man," but he still gave the other man his credit card.

"Alright," Ashton said then. "I'll go first."

He lost some of his coolness as he limped up the stage to retrieve his shoe and put it back on. He exchanged a few low words with his brother who moved over to the console of the karaoke machine. Ayr gave his brother a thumb up as he passed him the microphone.

"Hey V," he said as he pointed at me. And smirked. Which meant that whatever he said next was going to raise my hackles. "I'm going to start easy, okay?"

Bastard.

Ayr jumped out of the stage to join us and Link asked him, "What song did he choose?"

I leaned closer to hear what he'd say, but the waiter came with the drinks at that moment and distributed them among the two tables we'd hijacked all the way to the front by the small stage.

Ayr smirked, and although he looked exactly the same as his brother, he didn't give off the same vibe of trouble.

"Courtesy Call," was all he said.

Link's eyebrows went up. "Ohh, he's throwing the gauntlet. Frankly, I'm shocked they even had that song."

Ayr shrugged and took a sip of his coke. "Their system's hooked up to the internet, I just went online and found it there."

Without warning Ashton stated with a hey-o .

hey-o My attention turned to him. He stood in the middle of the stage looking at me like he knew I was going to get pissed in a second. I kinda jumped when he raised his voice in tune to the music and nearly fell back from my chair as the guitars exploded in the speakers. I turned around. Everybody, including the two employees, looked pretty unaffected at the volume. I guessed the bartender and waiter were used to the noise already, and my friends had grown deaf from the concert.

But I could feel the petulance in Ash's voice and it made my blood boil.

I felt the shift as he moved on the stage. I forgot about our surroundings and focused on him. He was a one man show. Moving in tune to the music and his voice as though he were the original singer at his own concert. As though his blood reacted to the music like it was his.

It was waking something in me that had me balling my hands into fists.

When he was done he spread his arms wide open and our friends clapped and hooted at him. He bowed in thanks and dropped the mic in the universal symbol of killing the game. That earned us a scolding from the bartender.

I didn't know what it was, but something took me up to the stage. I walked up to him and stood almost chest to chest. He looked down at me with a little smile that made me want to snarl.

There was a whistle followed by Leti's voice. "Vamos Vera! Show him what you got, mamacita!"

That broke me away from the staring contest. I rolled my eyes at her. "Really?"

She laughed and gave me two thumbs up.

I felt his hand on my elbow bring my attention back to him. "Let's give them a show, yeah?"

My face flushed because, between Leti's not so subtle jokes and the incessant innuendo spilling out of his mouth, whether he knew it or not. I didn't know what to think. But he walked me toward the karaoke machine and my eyes widened when I saw what he meant. He selected our song and found a second microphone.

"Ready for our first stage?" he asked me.

I felt it again. That frantic tingling like there was something inside of me that wanted to come up. I faced our audience and smiled at their confusion. I suddenly understood Ashton's intentions. It hadn't been to give them a battle of the singers.

His intention was to wow them.

The music started. I took a deep breath and opened my mouth.

"Holy shit."

That, ladies and gentlemen, was my best friend after the song finished.

She jumped to her feet and started clapping frantically. I threw a look at Ashton and he didn't seem the least surprised at the reaction.

Then DeAndre also joined Leti, eyes wide like he'd seen a ghost but clapping like his favorite team had scored. Link threw his head back and started to laugh.

"Well, no fucking wonder those girls were jealous of you," Addy said, smacking the table with such strength that the drinks rattled. "V you're amazing. You too, Ashton. You're both out of this world."

I hadn't known until that moment, as I wiped away a sweaty curl from my forehead, that this was what I'd chased for years. This approval. The feeling that no matter where I came from and how I looked, I had one thing that made others accept me. My cheeks hurt from smiling so hard. My heart felt like it was about to gallop its way out of my chest.

I'd never felt more alive.

In retrospective I could suddenly understand why, in a moment charged with adrenaline and giddiness, people did crazy things like marrying in Vegas or bungee jumping. Because at that moment the only thing I could think of to cope with the high was jumping into Ashton's arms, which easily came around me, and I would've kissed him if it weren't for the hooting audience.

I jumped back and hid my face in my hands. "I'm sorry."

He ran his fingers through his hair. "You won't hear me complaining."

Ayrton jumped to the rescue. I didn't know whose. He took the microphones from us and pushed off the stage.

"Now that the opening act is over, it's time for the real diva to shine. Me!"

I excused myself to the bathroom, where I splashed my face with cold water. I looked at myself in the mirror. At my wide brown eyes that stared back at me with shock. What the hell had I just been about to do? Kiss Ashton Winters in front of everybody? What would that accomplish?

I breathed in deeply for a minute, trying to calm myself down and the warring feelings inside me. The horror that I somehow thought I was entitled. And the hunger that, to quote Leti, holy shit, I wanted him. I wanted him bad.

I redid my pony tail with all the difficulty that came in dealing with a heavy mass of curls that had a mind of their own. It distracted me and when I came out of the bathroom I felt a little more myself. I still sat on the opposite end from Ashton, though. Just to make sure I could keep my hands to myself. DeAndre was beside me, looking at me in a way I'd never seen before.

I did a double take. "What?"

He shrugged and smiled a little. "I mean, I've heard you sing before. Just... never like that."



I rearranged myself on the chair. Yeah, he'd heard me sing at parties here and there. Things like Shakira and whatever the latest reggaeton there was playing in the radio. But none of that had been like this. This was next level. It was also wildly different from anything he was used to and I didn't know exactly how he took it.

"Is that a good thing?" I asked him, eager to hear that just because I wasn't singing a Latin song it didn't mean I was a sell out. "I know it's white people music and all but-"

"Fuck that," he said, cutting me off and though it worked I didn't feel irritated. "It might be, but you made it your own. That was incredible."

My smile was wide. "Thank you."

A movement from the corner of my eye caught my attention but I just saw Ashton shift toward Link and Addy in conversation. Ayr finished his George Michael song then and thanked us all for joining him that night.

Night.

The word registered in my brain like a slap to the face. I jumped on my feet and ran to the nearest window and saw that the sky was pitch black. I positively screamed.

They all rushed to me like they thought I was being held at gunpoint. Which in a way, I was. I knew I'd feel like staring down the barrel of a gun when I got home and my ma started screaming her lungs off at me.

"I have to get home!"

Leti jumped to action. She grabbed our purses and waved everybody off. "It's been great to meet you all, let's do this again but another day. Adios!"

"But-" one of them said, I didn't know who. Because I was dashing out of the karaoke bar and jumping in the back of DeAndre's car like we'd just robbed the place.

"Floor it," I told him.

DeAndre did no such thing, but we were all for sure tense as he drove us back to the barrio. Or at least I was. As I was running through one scenario after the other where I presented my ma a different excuse and got the same result of a chancleta imprinted on my face, my best friend swiveled around on her seat and smiled at me.

"You're so into that boy."

I was so into the certainty that I was going to be the first victim of chancletazos that it took me a second too long to register what she was talking about. When it dawned on me, though, I screamed at her, "am not!" And this only made her laugh.

When we rolled into our street and I saw that the lights in the gringo's house were on, I knew I was fucked.

"Well, it was great to know you all," I said. "Oren por mi."

"You'll be fine," Leti told me as we got out of the car. "I'll just tell your ma that it was all my fault. I forced you to go to some party with me. You didn't want to come but I convinced you."

I grabbed her hands and looked up at her with what I hoped were shiny eyes of gratitude. "You'd do that for me?"

"For a price, perra."

"Anything."

I probably should have thought that through and said anything other than that, because Leti was dangerous. But at that moment I didn't care. She and DeAndre flanked me as I walked the front yard to the front door, which ma threw open because she undoubtedly saw us pull into the curb.

"Vera Maria de la Cruz Vazquez, qué fue lo que te dije esta mañana?"

I cringed and nearly curled into a ball. When ma switched to full on Spanish it meant that the last rider of apocalypse was about to possess her.



"I'm sorry," I begun. All the excuses I'd gone through in my head during the ride flew out of my head. I opened and closed my mouth like a fish out of the water. Oh no, I didn't know what to do next. I saw ma bend down to grab a flip flop and at that moment a flashing light distracted all of us. We turned to its source and saw a white Jeep pull up in front of DeAndre's car.

"Oh no," I said. "No, please."

But of course, Ashton fucking Winters couldn't hear me all the way from there. All occupants in the car spilled out but it was he who helmed the procession up to our front door.

"What are you doing here?" I asked. Or more like, whined. His eyebrows went up.

But then my ma realized that was she was seeing was so beyond what was normal that, stupefied, she asked, "Why are there two of you?"

It'd have been funny if the circumstances weren't so dire.

Ayrton reached out his hand. "You must have met my brother before. Nice to meet you, ma'am. I'm Ayrton Winters."

She shook his hand, just to be polite. Because I could see that her dark eyes were blazing with the fires from hell. "Likewise, but may I ask what you all are doing at my home?"

Her attention shifted to Ashton as he said, "We just wanted to make sure your daughter got home safe."

I had to give him props. Even though my demise was going to happen any minute, Ashton showed her as much fearlessness as he'd shown when he stole me off his house from under my ma's nose. White privilege, if you asked me, of never having met the dirty end of a flip flop.

"And why would you do that?" Ma narrowed her eyes and looked him up and down with suspicion. "Why is the son of a senator hanging out with the daughter of a cleaning maid?"

My stomach fell into a pit as Addy and Link looked at me. They hadn't known this. Because I never wanted them, or anybody else, to know what my ma did for a living. And although I didn't see judgement in their faces, I did see surprise.

But of course, Ashton always upped the ante.

Just as if they were discussing the weather he said, "Because I like your daughter, and I care that she's safe and-" He looked down at the flip flop in my ma's hand. "Unharmed."

We could've heard the drop of a pin in the silence that followed.

For that same reason I worried that they could all hear how fast my heart was beating. My eyes glued on Ashton's face. It was calm on the surface, but his eyes were full of steel. He looked like his dad probably did when facing a tough political opponent.

Except he'd said something outrageous. My jaw dropped.

"There you have it." Leti smiled and stepped in between Ash and my ma. "We're all home safe and early, right? It's only 8 o'clock or something. Can you please forgive Vera? We're all begging you."

Ayrton won the puppy dog eyes contest by far. He alone softened my ma's expression. She did give Ashton another up and down scan. The most terrifying words I'd ever heard spilled out of her mouth.

"You and I will have a word alone now." The she looked from him to me. "You, go into your room."

I looked at the others and opened my mouth, but she cut me off with a glare. Leti grabbed DeAndre and headed to her home. Ash gave his brother the keys to the Jeep and followed ma and I inside.

Once she shut the door I said, "Ma, por fa-"

She lifted a finger. "Vera Maria, grab Victor and go to your room. Right now."

Her Spanish accent was thick and I felt like she was this close to shifting to Spanish curses, so I gave Ashton one last look I hoped conveyed how sorry I was to have the mother I had, and grabbed my little brother. I sat on my bed with him as Victor complained that he left his toy truck in the living room. I gave him one of my stuffed toys and hoped that would distract him.

I couldn't hear shit of what was going on, so I tip toed to the door and opened it just a fraction. I could hear their murmurs but it was too soft for me to discern any words. A moment late the front door opened and closed and there was silence.

Steps were coming from the hallway so I ran to the bed and pretended to play as ma opened the door and stood there, arms folded. She was still furious, but something was holding back her tongue. I didn't press her for anything, but after a moment longer she said.

"I don't want you anywhere near that boy again. Do you understand?"

I knew better than to disagree with my ma, so I just nodded. She picked my brother up and gave me one last glare before she left.

I sat in the dark and silence with her words ringing in my head as loud as the music from the concert. Ashton had just said he liked me in front of everybody and my ma forbid me from seeing him.

I put my face in my hands. "What the fuck just happened?"

My phone vibrated then and I pulled it out from the pocket of my jeans. There was a text from Ashton.

I swiped the screen to unlock it and read it.

It wasn't a lie .

♪ I Can Get No (Self Satisfaction) ♪

Ma thought she was punishing me by taking me back to school just before curfew on Sunday night, and I did a pretty good job at pretending to be surly, but she did me a favor instead. She parked the car by the entrance and I jumped out to gather my bags. I looked up at the looming building with a sense that it was enclosing on me and for the first time I had the impression like it was it what I wanted to escape, instead of ma.

it All because of a stupid boy.

When she rolled down the window and told me to behave and stay away from those kids, I even agreed with her whole heartedly.

I waited until her car disappeared down the street to face the front door. If I stumbled upon somebody on my way upstairs, and by somebody I had a very specific person in mind, I would pray for spontaneous combustion to get me out of any possible conversation. I was really irritated that from the beginning of my time at Trinity, a rich, white boy was shaping my life around him. First, it was ma and now this. When was I going to become the owner of my own fate?

I squared my shoulders and pushed the door open. A partial answer was that if I kept running away from the things I didn't want to face, I was sure to keep allowing everybody else to push me around. Like water in a river, just taken by gravity and smacking rocks around.

I wanted to be the gravity.

There were a few younger kids lounging around the stairs as I made my way to the girls room 43. The door was unlocked and I figured that Addy was inside. I found her sprawled on the floor cutting fabric of a vibrant orange color, listening to some chill music. She looked up at me.

"Hey."

My brow creased. There was a tad of tension in her voice. I scrambled my brains trying to think of what I might have done to upset her, but came up short. I dumped my backpack on my bed and pushed my suitcase under my bed. Then I sat down to see what she was doing. There were lines drawn all across the fabric into what I assumed was the pattern, but I couldn't make out what it was supposed to be.

"Is it a sweater?" I guessed.

"A jacket, actually." She pulled away and set the scissors down for a moment, looking at her work like it had been a while since she looked at the whole instead of the detail. "Persimmon is my favorite color and I kind of want to make me a persimmon power suit. With buttons of different colors."

I could see her in it, tall and powerful and taking no sass from anybody. "Sounds awesome, actually."

When the praise didn't soften her expression, I knew something was up. I folded my hands on my lap and took a deep breath.

"Okay, what's going on?"

She folded her arms and leveled me a stare.

"Frankly, I'm a little wounded," she said.



I looked down at my hands, fretting with the hem of my t-shirt. "What did I do?"

There was a break of silence before she sighed. "I guess it's not big deal and I'm just being a prick. But why didn't you tell me?"

My head was still spinning with confusion. "Tell you what?"

Addy shrugged. "About your family, your background."

I had an epiphany at that second, as my body reacted to how freaked out I was when understanding dawned on me. I broke into a sweat as if I were a mall fountain being turned on. It was why I couldn't stand being in the spotlight. I couldn't help but to disappoint. If I told everybody here where I came from, they'd turn their backs on me. Now that they'd found out, they probably thought I was beneath them and a liar.

"Did you think I was going to judge?" she continued. "Because, I get it, this school is full of snobs who think they're all that, but I didn't think you felt like I was one of them."

"No!" I jumped out of the bed and fell to my knees next to her. "No, I don't think you're a snob. I just... I didn't want you to think less of me."

Addy tilted her head and a curtain of strawberry blonde hair fell over her shoulder. "Why would I?"

I closed my mouth. Lowered my hands. Then I gave it a solid thought. Her honest, earnest eyes had only the hurt at possibly being found judgmental. There was no disgust, no apprehension in them. I felt even worse, because that meant I had assumed she wouldn't be able to handle my reality without even giving her a choice in the matter. I almost smacked my forehead when I thought of the twins. I'd also judged Ashton when I thought he was his brother, but once he found out the truth he hadn't given a single flying shit about it. Ayrton had even mentioned he preferred my neighborhood, and hadn't even seemed delusional about it.

I drew in a deep breath and filled my lungs to capacity.

So, rich people were capable of being open minded. Some, more so than poor little old me.

"Right. I see." I pursed my lips and looked her dead in the eye. "I'm sorry. I subconsciously was protecting myself from getting judged, but I guess I kinda judged you back that way."

To my surprise, her face broke into a smile. "I have a friend who is just like you, in a way. I mean, you're not the pretentious little ass that he is, but he's also like, deathly afraid for people to know his parents came from a south american country to clean houses and then married rich."

"Wow." I leaned back against my bed and decided that I trusted Addy. If I could open myself up to her I had a feeling she could be as good a friend to me as Leti, but with a lot less hot headedness. "Well, my ma's plan wasn't to come from Venezuela to be a cleaning lady."

She startled. "From where?"

"Venezuela."

"Holy shit, I have to introduce you to my friend. His parents are from there."

My jaw dropped. It dropped even more when she showed me a picture and. Hot. Damn.

"Is he single?" I asked.

Addy put her hand on my shoulder and shook her head, waves of pity radiating off of her. "I'm sorry. He's probably taken by ten different girls right now. He's what is commonly described as a Latin Lover."

I gagged. I'd seen my fair share of those in the barrio, and thanks partly to me being, well, me, and having Leti as a friend, they kept the hell away. An undisguised blessing.

"On second thought, maybe don't introduce him to me," I said, which made her laugh. "But then, I guess I can't blame him. If my ma had married rich I might have become worse than Madison and her friends. Instead she got pregnant young and didn't succeed in showbiz like she wanted."



This perked her interest, so I told her the whole, sad story. Addy pulled out some snacks from under her bed and we shared them as we talked. She was an only child from soon to be divorced parents who thought that giving her anything she wanted was the same as showering her with love. I told her that parents, no matter their social status, seemed to all be dumb.

"So, wait," she said as she chewed on some Skittles. "Does your mom know you're joining a band?"

I rolled my eyes. "Oh my God, I'm not joining any stupid bands."

"So you say, because you haven't seen yourself singing with Ashton to know how you came alive." She grabbed her cellphone again. "Lucky for you, I recorded you guys."

I made a grab for her phone but she held it out of my reach with her superior arm length advantage. "Give me that. Delete that video!"

"Hell to the no, you guys have more chemistry than all the crap in the AP Chemistry lab." She used the pause made by my stunned silence to press play on the video and showed it to me. I cringed as I saw myself on screen. Wide, awkward and drowning under an explosion of curls atop my head. And then there was Ashton. Confident, gorgeous Ashton.

But then we started singing.

It was like seeing two different people on stage. He became this intense, commanding feature. He attracted my eyes and for a moment I didn't see anything else. But then mini me opened her mouth on the screen and this gigantic voice came out. Even with the poor quality recording and all the background noise coming from the table where Addy had been sitting, I heard this stranger's amazing voice and I felt it in my bones.

"Who the hell is that?" I asked, stupefied.

"That's you, idiot." She zoomed in on me. At a particularly dramatic line in the song I saw my entire body expand, as if it wanted to be larger than it was. As if it wanted to compete with my voice and it didn't care who was watching. For a second, it seemed, like I hadn't cared who was watching.

I always cared. I was always conscious of what people would think about me. But at that second, on the small stage of a random karaoke bar in the shadiest parts of Orlando, I hadn't given a damn and had just sang.

I sat back on my haunches, realizing the enormity of what I just saw. I looked back at my friend. Her face was full of excitement. As though she'd just seen a celebrity.

"This is crazy, that can't be me."

Addy ignored me and tossed her phone away. "Okay so I'm not a graphic designer but I'm thinking of some ideas for a band logo."

"What?"

"And also, I think the aesthetic of you guys on stage is going to be crucial," she continued, not noticing that I was having a mental breakdown right there and then. "But I guess you'll all need to decide first what kind of vibe your music will go for, and then let me know and I'll whip up some cool outfits."

I raised my palms up and shook them as though I was trying to conjure a wall out of thin air. "Addy, stop. Wait, you're talking as if this were a fact. I haven't joined a freaking band! I don't even know how I'm going to face Ashton tomorrow."

That stopped her for a second. "What do you mean?"

I scratched my elbow and looked away. "I, uh. Well, yesterday was kind of... And he said-"

"That he likes you. In front of everybody, I know." Her grin showed all of her pearly whites. "We all gave him a lot of crap about it the entire ride back after that."

I put my face in my hands. She pried one of my hands away so she could make eye contact.

"Just tell him if you don't like him and that's that."

"I don't not like him."

I gasped at my admission. I broke into a sweat again, especially as she also gasped.

"No wonder seeing you both sing together felt like watching something intimate." She winced as I smacked her, hard. "Okay but he likes you and you like him. What's the big deal?"

"My honest thoughts?" I asked her and she nodded. A sigh that robbed me of my energy left my lungs. "I think... he just really likes my singing. That's it. He doesn't even know me much."

Addy shrugged. "It's only been shy of two months since we started school. Neither do you. But by that logic, why do you like him?"

I groaned and raised my knees to hug them, trying to become a little ball. With a small voice I admitted, "He's cool and hot. And I don't like like him, it's just a little crush. Meanwhile I'm awkward and ugly. He's confused when he says he likes me. It's just my voice. Ashton Winters can't possibly even have a crush on me."

like "Ugh!" Addy threw her arms back and sagged against her bed, her patterns forgotten on the floor between us. Her eyebrows crashed as she looked into my eyes. "Listen to me, all of that makes a lot of sense. Except for the part where you're convinced you're ugly. But in matters of the heart, there's no logic. You should chuck all that out the window and just have fun."

I pursed my lips. "Yeah well, trust me. I'd have a lot more fun if I didn't have to deal with Ashton Winters."

Of that I was completely sure.

♪ Eye of The Kitten ♪ I really wanted to follow Addy's advice and chuck all my reservations out the window, but I still found myself hovering outside our classroom door for as many seconds as I could stretch without being tardy. I'd seen Ashton and Link walk in together ahead of me a few minutes ago, and despite a crappy night of sleep thanks to a head full of thoughts and excuses, I still hadn't thought of what to do when I first saw him.

Someone cleared their throat behind me and I found myself faced by Mr. Burlington.

"Good morning, sir."

He returned the greeting to me, and then with a smile motioned me inside. Every eye was on us as we walked in, only a second before the alarm rang. I paused as I realized that quite a few seats were empty, including Quinn's.

Then to my surprise, I found Lincoln sitting behind my desk. He lifted one hand and wiggled his fingers at me, which was kind of funny with the fact that his face remained deadpan. Over the corner of my eye I saw Ashton sitting at the front. I quickly scurried over to sit on my chair.

I leaned toward Addy and whispered, "What's going on?"

She turned, and was about to say something when the teacher cleared his throat.

"Let's all say a prayer for our baseball team, which is preparing to play today." He clasped his hands in front of himself. "Let's hope our boys can leave our school's name in good standing."

As he paused and looked down for a minute, I felt Link shift behind me. I turned to him and he passed me a note. After unfolding it, it read: He said he owed you a favor and that this is probably what you'd ask for . I tossed him a thank you over my shoulder and he returned it with a second note. This one said, He'll see you plenty once we start band practice .

He said he owed you a favor and that this is probably what you'd ask for He'll see you plenty once we start band practice "Dios mío," I said. All eyes turned to me. I sank on my chair and said, "Sorry, just praying in Spanish."

The most annoying thing was catching Ashton's eye and seeing that he was struggling not to laugh. To top it off, as if she knew exactly what was going on, Addy turned around to me and gave me a thumbs up. I remembered how chummy chummy the three of them had seemed on Saturday and realized that yes, all three of them were in on whatever campaign they had to get me to join this imaginary band. Ridiculous.

I needed to focus on what really mattered. Studying my ass off.

This, of course, meant that I couldn't concentrate. Between Addy giving me funny looks all throughout, Leti blowing up my cellphone and asking for deets that didn't exist, and the coursework being so tough, my brain had trouble coping with everything. By lunch time I felt like it was beginning to leak out of my ears.

Madison and her friends passed me by with trays loaded with miniature gardens and identical bottles of kombucha. I rolled my eyes but then I caught their queen bee smiling at me. It gave me a shudder.



"What do you want?" I asked.

She shrugged a delicate shoulder. "Nothing, just looking forward to music club today."

And then there was that.

I grunted and veered away from her to join Addy on our usual table. "Do you think I can tell the teachers that I'm behind schedule on course work and need to skip club today?"

She hummed. "My guess is a solid no."

I bit into my sandwich with more anger than the situation required. "You're supposed to be my friend, but you're working for him."

We turned around and saw Ashton and Link sitting together halfway through the cafeteria away from us. They looked like they were conspiring. I turned back to glare at my roommate.

Her angelic smile put me off. "I'm not working for him, that would require some sort of income and the only thing I'm getting out of this is seeing you come out of your shell."

I hunched my shoulders and munched on my food. After a while I said, "But I like my shell."

"Maybe you think you do, but it doesn't suit you."

That single line stayed dancing in my head the entire afternoon. I even found myself writing it down on my notebook instead of writing down the math equations. During that period the entire class started to buzz with excitement. It turned out our team won its game and were just a few steps away from a big tournament. Since I had no school pride whatsoever, I kept trying to focus on the curriculum and banish any other distractions from my mind.

Okay so I was like a snail. The only way I'd shed my shell was if I found a bigger, more comfortable one. Joining a band with a bunch of rich kids was far from that notion. Like a snail, I'd freaking die without my shell.

After last period was done, I jumped on my feet and nearly ran out of the classroom. There was an hour to spare before the orchestra assembled and I intended to use it to put a dent on my homework.

"V, wait."

My first reaction was to freeze when I heard the words behind me. And my steps faltered, alright, but I kept power walking to the library. I realized he was following when I saw people here and there step out of the way, and then started panicking when we reached an empty patch of hallway with no doors. I had nowhere to hide.

"Stop following me." I hissed over my shoulder. He had his hands in his pockets, guitar case slung over his shoulder and didn't seem to be in any hurry, even as he followed me on par to my quick steps. "Why are you even following me?"

"Because you're not stopping."

I knew that, once more, I was playing right into his trap, but I stopped and turned to face him. He stopped, too.

When I felt ages passed without him saying a word, I folded my arms and tapped my foot on the floor. "Well?"

His lips stretched into a little smile that made my stomach do somersaults. I couldn't get used to seeing that, as if every time it felt like I was going to burst into a million butterflies that would fly away and leave nothing of me left.

"Nothing, just wondering how you're doing."

I couldn't believe the nerve on a white boy. I gave him my best resting bitch face and turned around. He fell into step beside me.

"Okay, so that wasn't what I wanted to say." A whole lot of silence acknowledged him, so he decided to fill it in. "I also didn't mean for that to come out the way it did on Saturday. It just, kind of did."

that

I kept walking, my feet moving out of inertia. I said, "Look, it was the heat of the moment. You guys were just trying to get my ma off my back and you said that to shock the fight out of her. Thanks for trying, but let's just move on and pretend nothing happened."

"Why?"

The sound of his shoes hitting the floor stopped. I turned around slowly, as if expecting an axe murderer. I wasn't prepared for the cocktail of emotions on his face.

I wasn't prepared for any of this.

After days of thinking what to say, what to do, when this very moment happened, I had sudden clarity. I'd said so to Addy yesterday. This wasn't about him liking me, it was about him liking the way he felt when he heard me sing.

I faced him fully.

"Ash, you're just confused." His forehead crinkled as I said this, but at least he didn't contradict me right away. "You don't like me . You barely even know me. What you like is whatever fantasy you've made of me after you heard me sing a few times."

me It was the same as the crush I had last year on DeAndre. I liked the way I felt around him because he was a pretty boy who treated me nice. I liked thinking of what that could mean, that he maybe thought of me as more than just a friend, but in reality it was all about me. What was in my head. And not what reality really was.

It was just mind blowing to think that for the first time this was directed at me. And from the hottest guy in school, no less.

I took a step forward and narrowed my eyes as I looked up at his baby blues. "I bet you that if I couldn't sing for shit you wouldn't even know my name."

When he didn't say anything to that, I took it as my confirmation that I was right. I nodded once and turned back to head to the library.

"Maybe it's true," he said.

The unexpected thing was that I felt like a knife was driven right through me.

Ashton caught up with me and continued. "Maybe I just have a deep, mad crush on your voice. Maybe it's not at all about you being smart and good and no nonsense, you know, things I didn't have in my previous relationship."

Every beat of my heart was painful, like it was trying to do its work even as it bled out from a fresh wound. I was disturbed that I felt so deeply at hearing my own thoughts confirmed back at me from the mouth of the boy in question. I should've been all blasé about it.

"What's your point?" There was a lot more bite to that question than I'd have liked to infuse.

"Maybe what we should do is for you to give me a chance to figure out which of the two is true."

My eyes widened as saucers. He didn't appear half as affected by this whole thing as I was. Curse him.

"So I have a proposal for you," he said, lifting his eyebrows in defiance. "I think we should hang out more, see if I keep liking you after prolonged exposure."

My jaw unhinged. Ashton flashed me a grin that had me clenching my fists.

"And the best way to do that is by joining my band."

I threw my hands up and screamed in frustration. I felt like I'd been toyed with and been had. I didn't know if he was the carrot or the stick, but I was definitely the stupid, ignorant horse.

"How does everything lead to your stupid band?"

"First of all, it's not stupid." He lifted one finger and then the second. I wanted to bite them and inflict the same pain on him that he made me feel. "Second of all, think about it. It's perfect. To make the band succeed we'll have to work harder than we ever had before. That's for sure going to make tempers flare. If I still say I like you after all of that, then you'll have to accept that I like you for real."



I put my hands on my face.

"You need to stop saying that." I paused, suddenly catching onto something. "Just wait a minute. How grand is this fantasy of yours to think about us succeeding with a band?"

He leaned down, as if he were about to share a big secret. I knew the smile that was coming to him. It was the same one he showed me when he was about to take a bite out of life.

"I'm talking triple platinum records, baby."

I punched him in the shoulder. The blow was hard enough that it forced him back, and I could breathe again.

"You're crazy." As he complained about the pain, I added, "And don't call me baby. And don't back me into weird corners."

He laughed, understanding my joke. And I liked just a tad too much imagining him watching Dirty Dancing.

"Think about it, what do you have to lose?" His eyes gleamed with the confidence of someone who knew he could do whatever he damn well pleased.

That wasn't the case for me.

"My scholarship if my grades drop?" I shrugged. "My chance at going far, far away to a good college?"

He ran his hand through his hair, looking off into the distance. "All good points, but what I promise that you can ace your exams and also be in the band?" My unamused stare didn't seem to affect him. "And, what if I tell you, that making music could take you even farther away than college?"

My bravado fractured.

Music sure had taken my ma far from her homeland, but it hadn't taken her out of poverty. Cleaning houses had. What he was painting wasn't something in my reach. He couldn't just say that, as if it were easy.

I walked to him and grabbed his tie, yanking him down to my eye level. I felt a rush through my body at how easy it'd be to wrap my arms around his neck and just kiss him, at how he didn't seem to mind. But I quashed that feeling.

"Do you know how many people try to make it into the music industry, and don't succeed?" I searched in his eyes for any fear. And didn't find any. "Do you know how many people fade in obscurity, even though they were the best flutist, or the best singer or composer? Do you know what happens to them?"

He looked down at my lips, then back to my eyes. "What?"

"They have to drop music and start cleaning houses for a living."

Ash pulled my hand away from his tie and straightened up. I noticed a second late that he still held my hand.

"Is that what happened to your mom, then?" He squeezed it. "Is that why you're afraid to free your voice, and yourself?"

I drew in a sharp breath.

I didn't know, hadn't realized that this was really what was beneath the surface. I blinked away sudden tears.

"I- I have to go study."

But he didn't let me go. When I tried to turn away, he tugged at my hand until I faced him. The challenge had taken root in him and wouldn't let go.

"Will you at least try?" The corner of his lips lifted. "Who knows, it might just change your life."

I sighed. "And bet my entire life on your mad idea? Hell no."

"For fun, then?" He blinked innocently. "Surely you want some fun in your life."

Since he said this while giving me The Look, the one paired with a raised eyebrow and a very strategic lip bite, I figured there was nothing innocent behind his question. And of course I wanted some fun, mainly involving him and our limbs tangled together, but I was sure that this wouldn't be good for my grades.

As if reading my mind he added, "Schoolwork first, band second and you and I third?"

I tugged my hand away, feeling like my face was catching on fire. We both knew he'd won the fucking battle when I struggled to even smack him with any decent force. Instead he captured my hand away and laced our fingers together. I melted.

I lifted my chin. "There's a major flaw in your scheme."

The smile on his face irritated me just as it delighted me.

"What's that?"

"I thought you were missing more people in your band."

Ash pressed his lips in annoyance, and I couldn't help but notice them.

Bad Vera.

"If I find the missing members, will you finally join?"

I smirked. There were a lot of musicians in our school. All classically trained and prissy. None of them had the type of people I saw on Saturday, with their mohawks and piercings, tattoos and all black gear. Nobody here even wore Vans. He was screwed and we both knew it. Looking for bandmates in a sea of plastic people would keep him entertained for a while. His feet would swiftly meet the ground. His fantasy would vanish and his hallucinations about me with it. I'd be able to focus on my study and not on what the next drama about Ashton Winters was.

And even though I was probably going to hate being proven right, it would be for the best. Finally I'd get my life on track.

I pulled my hand away, adjusted the straps of my backpack and gave him a confident, shit eating grin that hurt me a little on the inside.

"Sure."

♪ We Will Shock You ♪

The next day was what felt to me like the beginning of the end.

The period before lunch ended and Addy and I stood up, chatting about how hungry we were. I was really hoping there was pizza at the cafeteria today, because I felt like I needed a treat after acing a couple of assignments. And then Link got up behind me and intercepted us on our way to the door.

"Ladies, follow me."

Addy and I exchanged a glance. I narrowed my eyes at her and she shrugged.

"What? I really don't know what his deal is."

Out of curiosity, we followed him. He stopped just outside where Ashton stood, unfurling a colorful poster. The other boy reached out to help him tack it on to the announcements board of our floor. Once they stepped back and I was able to see the content of the poster, I felt like my stomach plummeted to the ground and I realized that I never should have agreed to his challenge.

"Drummer and bassist required for the coolest rock band on Earth. Auditions this Friday," Addy read with a sense of awe to her voice. "This is finally happening, huh?"

"No." I took a step back, shaking my head. All of them turned back to me. "No, no."

I stopped when I bumped into someone. I turned around to find Quinn and Madison, holding hands as they looked at Ashton or the poster. I wasn't sure.

Link broke the sudden tension that had fallen into the group. "You guys applying or what?"

The queen bee flipped her perfect hair back and said, "As if. Let's go." She tugged her boyfriend's hand away and even though his body followed, his eyes stayed on us for a while longer.

Was that longing on them?

I turned around, seeking for an explanation from anybody. Addy at least looked as confused as I was, but the two boys were back to focus on the poster.

"Ta da!" Ashton spread his arms open as if regaling me with a great feat. "Challenge accepted."

I balled my fist at him but then I remembered this was Holy Trinity High School For The Rich And Uptight, and that I had the upper hand in the demographics. Rich kids with the world on their hands wouldn't be interested in this. He could do whatever he wanted.

I regarded the poster again and nodded. "Good move, but you're still going down."

He faced me off with an annoying little smile. "We'll see."

By the time lunch was done, this was all everybody could talk about. The whole school was abuzz with the fact that the top hottest senior wanted to make a band. I overhead a bunch of girls in the bathroom talk about how they planned to start learning drums or something just so they could join his band and stare at him up close. After a bout of giggling about how gorg he was, one of them complained that four days was not enough, and that it was so unfair of him to not give them more time until the audition.

gorg

I stepped out of my stall at the same time as someone else did. Madison. The younger girls took a look at us and scrammed.

"Fools," she said as she lathered her hands with the nice soap they put out in the bathrooms. "What they don't get is that that's precisely the point. Anyone who is ready to audition in such a short notice is already prepared."

I paused. Then I looked at her. She deliberately checked her makeup in the mirror with probably more care than was necessary.

No way, she wasn't going to-

She rolled her eyes. "It's only logical."

I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off as I watched her leave. Nothing about Madison seemed casual. Maybe it was because of the way people referred to her that I had a feeling like she was focused, controlling and manipulative. Sure, we'd been wrong when we thought she was the culprit behind my disappearing clothes, and maybe I was reading too much between the lines, but it kind of seemed to me like she was interested in this audition thing.

But that had to be crazy talk. For one, she was a violinist. I had a sudden imagine of her banging on the drums without any reason or tune and a laugh bubbled up out of my throat. Even for me, just because I could sing the one rock song I knew didn't mean I could pull off the entire genre, not that I was seriously considering it. But Madison? She looked like a real life Barbie. Like if she broke a nail she would make the world burn for it. If she'd gone to that rock concert on Saturday the masses would have swallowed her whole. The girl had less street cred in all of her than my left foot.

I dried my hands and tossed the tissue down the trash, along with that random thought of Madison in Ashton's band. I was sure she was just interested because she still wanted to know whatever her ex was up to.

A couple of days later the call for auditions was all over social media. Leti texted me about it, which was the craziest thing to me.

"How did you even find out?" I half asked, half screamed at her over the phone on loudspeaker Thursday night.

She laughed. "I added your friend Addy on Facebook. She made my wall explode."

Since I was sitting across from my roommate as she did her homework, I grabbed a pillow and tossed it at her. It caught her straight on the head, and since she'd been listening to our conversation she wasn't terribly surprised. She still socked me right in the nose with hers, and the strength of the blow caught me off guard.

"God damn it, Addy. You're too strong."

She shrugged. "You started it."

I rubbed my nose and picked up the phone again. "Why do I feel like you both are conspiring against me behind my back?"

"Not against you," Leti said.

Addy nodded as she typed on her laptop. "For you. We agree this band needs to happen."

My phone started buzzing with a second incoming call. I nearly dropped it.

"Why's Ashton calling me right now?"

As Leti cooed in the background, Addy jumped and grabbed my phone. I stood on my bed, because surely this way I'd be able to reach for it, but then she got on her bed and did the same, so the advantage was gone and moot.

"Hey Leti, I'll put you on hold," she said and then clicked on the screen. "Hey Ashton?"

"Addy?" I heard him ask as I folded my arms.

She laughed. "Oh wow, you sound so disappointed that it's me and not Vera."

I grabbed her pillow and chucked it at her, but she dodged it easily. "What do you want?" I asked him.



He cleared his throat, as if prompting us to start behaving. "Not much, just calling to ask if you're joining us for the audition tomorrow."

Addy replied, "Yes, she is."

"Why the hell would I?" I exploded. My roommate started sniggering as if she were being tickled on her sides by feathers.

I could almost see Ashton shrug. "I thought you'd want to see firsthand if you lost the war or not."

I let out a grunt in frustration because he was right, again. I was pretty confident that nobody in this school cut it, but I couldn't pass up savoring the moment of glory and gloat in his face about it.

So on Friday night I found myself sitting first row in the music room, as Ashton and company set up a makeshift stage for the auditions.

Addy rubbed her hands together beside me. "Ohh, this gon be good."

I pursed my lips and glared at her. "You're hanging out online with Leti way too much."

"Speaking of." She pulled out her cellphone. "She asked me to record the really bad ones for a laugh."

I sank in my seat. They were evil and I loved them, but instead of pushing this along they should've helped me sabotage it.

Link brushed off his hands as he perused at their work. "Looks about ready." Then he looked up to the doors and smiled. "They look ready, too."

Addy and I turned around. To my shock, the door was brimming with people waiting to be called in.

As Ashton passed by us on his way to them, he gave us a triumphant smirk.

Had I been missing a key bit of information here? I turned to Addy and asked her if by chance there were other rock prodigies in this freaking school and she shook her head.

The first audition was so bad that I realized one could simultaneously feel like dying of secondhand embarrassment and also of choking back laughter. Addy recorded the whole thing and sent it to Leti, who, a few minutes later filled her entire screen with the laughing emoji.

Ashton's confidence hadn't been pegged down a notch just yet.

"Wait for it," he told me. He sat next to me and tugged at a strand of my curls. "You'll see."

And see I did. A sea of people who had less of an idea of what they were doing than what I had of being there. I leaned back on my chair as one person after another passed, some tone deaf, some so terrified they couldn't even show if they knew what they were doing, others who thought banging at the drum or strumming some strings incoherently was going to be enough for Ash and Link. By what was probably the twentieth kid was done, I could tell that the two boys were starting lose their composure.

My face hurt from smiling so hard.

"So, Ashton. What happens when this band doesn't happen?" I asked him.

Deadpan he turned to me, "Plan B is to open auditions outside of Trinity. Don't worry, this band will happen."

I snorted. But then I looked back at the sound of the door opening for the next contender and choked on my own saliva.

Madison and Quinn strutted down the music hall to the stage.

Addy's jaw dropped. I looked at Link, whose eyes had never seemed so big before.

Ashton's face was the true work of art here. It was frozen in a snarl that would have made him seem scary if he weren't so pretty.

"What are you doing here?"



Madison put a hand on her chest, her expression one of casual surprise, if that wasn't even a thing. "Why do you ask? We're here to audition. Unless the positions have already been filled." One look at us and she had her answer. "I didn't think so."

"This audition is not open to you," Ash said. Then he looked at his ex best friend. "Or you."

Quinn rolled his eyes. "Cut the crap, Ash. You know you need us. Nobody else in this school can even come close to meeting your standards."

"And you can?" I blurted out. I lifted my palms up as many glares were directed at me. "Honest question, though. I thought you were an athlete."

He relaxed at that and nodded. "Yeah, but I was also Ashton's roommate since freshman year. He taught me how to play drums so that he could play band."

"Wait, wait." I shifted narrowed eyes to Ashton. "You had a band before? With Quinn? Who else?"

He pressed his lips shut.

I pointed at Madison, wordlessly. She smiled.

"Whoa," I said. Everything suddenly made sense. Why she seemed to know so much about this whole auditioning thing. The two missing members had been in front of my nose all along. Ashton had a trump card if he wanted to use them and win this freaking challenge, but he was refusing to because— well, they did do a nasty on him.

"It used to be Ash, his brother, Quinn and I," Madison supplied, walking over to pick a bass. She tuned it to her liking with the same care she used when setting up her violin before practice. She looked just as elegant with the massive instrument hanging from her frame. It seemed too big and heavy for her, but she handled it with ease.

I looked at Link. "What about you?"

He shrugged. "I was more of a solo act."

"Then, what changed?" I asked him and jumped out of my skin when he pointed at my face.

"So, okay, I admit it's kind of funny to see Ash squirm," Madison said with a kiss blown at his surly face. "But I'm also intrigued about his vision for a band with you in it."

I jumped to my feet. "Me?"

"You're very different to Ayrton," Quinn said as he sat behind the drums.

I fiddled with my hands. "Well, no shit."

The pretty black boy twirled the sticks like they were second nature to his hands. Then he asked his girlfriend, "How are we doing this?"

"You lead and I follow," she told him, which was not something I ever thought I'd hear. It always seemed to me like she jerked him around everywhere and he just complied to her whims.

But then he clicked his sticks three times and hit the drums with so much energy that I stumbled back a few steps, until I felt the chair with the back of my legs and sat down. Madison made her bass squeal almost like it was a guitar and she was transformed. In her expensive private school uniform and cascades of blonde hair, she was like an apparition of rock and roll made woman. I didn't know if they'd rehearsed this, but the ease with which they played, tuned to each other, was not something that anyone could pull off easily. I felt like when I was watching those tribute bands, like there was a different world out there and my feet itched to take me into it. I looked around me. The same awe was written on Addy's face. Link smiled as though he knew this would be the outcome all along, and the bastard probably did.

Ashton looked resigned. And that was how I knew I never should have told him that, sure, if he found the last bandmates I'd join.

I wasn't even going to start coming up with excuses to back out of my word, because I didn't want to. At that second, with my blood reaching a boiling, I wanted to learn how to sing this music and make the world burn.

♪ Freaks Without A Leash ♪

It occurred to me that if I was going to do this thing I better be prepared. In a way, I've always been behind schedule. Born without a regular family, in a country with customs that were foreign to my mother who has basically trialled and erred throughout my life to learn how to play by the local rules. With no health insurance, no benefits, no solid education. We've never spoken about it, it was too risky, but I was sure that ma had married the gringo, not because he was a prince who arrived to sweep her off her feet, but because he was the first American man who liked her enough to marry her and secure her permanent stay in this country.

This wasn't normal. I was not normal.

I was the daughter of a failed singer who got knocked up at 19 by her business manager. A man who disappeared from her life soon after.

And I inherited one thing from both of them. My desire to be on stage.

After the auditions, my head was dancing with the understanding that I lost the battle. That this band was happening. And that I was going to give it a try. Not just because I gave Ashton my word, but because I'd never been, until that night, closer to living out my fantasy. Sure, Leti, DeAndre and the others from my barrio liked it when I sang salsa and merengue songs at parties, but that wasn't anywhere close to the euphoria I felt in the crowd at that rock concert my friends took me to.

I wanted that. I craved to see if I had it in me to cause that kind of reaction. I needed to know if I could be anything more than the short, fat Latina girl with the untamable curls and a penchant for squirming under attention.

I went back into my dorm room, put on my headphones and looked up that band on Youtube, the one that had the only rock song I even knew how to sing. At first the music was too strident for my taste, it didn't make me want to shake my hips. But then I started to weed out the details. The dark lyrics. The overlapping melodies and the emotion coming from each instrument. Drama. Pain.

I fucking loved it.

I didn't sleep a wink that night. Listening to different songs on repeat, then going down the rabbit hole of Youtube's next recommendations. Some were from the same band, but somewhere around 2am I begun listening to other bands.

If anyone asked me, I'd never have described this music as soothing, yet I eventually found myself drifting off to sleep, and as Youtube kept suggesting one song after the next, I had the most amazing dream.

Pitch black. A single spotlight in the middle, the light broken by wisps of curling smoke. My feet were moving, compelled by something I couldn't explain. As I walked closer to the light, I could see that there was something under it, just within my reach.

A microphone.

I saw my hand reaching for it, as though I was outside of my own body. But I still felt my lips part, I felt the breath going into my lungs. And then...



"Are you ready?" I asked. In my more conscious mind I wondered who I was asking that to. The nothingness in front of me? Myself?

And then a million voices replied all at once. What I thought was pitch black lit up like the sky at night, full of stars. But they weren't stars. They were the flashes of cameras, of flashlights.

I was the star.

I jolted awake so hard that my torso sprang forward. And then I saw a different set of stars as my forehead collided with something.

"Agh!"

The voice was a strange one in my room. I tried to rub off the throbbing ache from my forehead and saw Madison standing next to my bed, clutching her head like she was trying to keep it from splitting open.

"Do you have bricks for a head?" she asked me, glaring through teary eyes.

I fell back on my bed and curled into a ball. Through gritted teeth I asked her, "It's your fault for doing whatever it was that made you stand so close to me. What the hell are you doing here?"

Had she been about to shave off my eyebrows or something?

That was when I realized that the commotion had woken up Addy, who also had tears in her eyes but from trying so hard not to laugh.

"What?" I asked her, fiddling with my face. "Did she do something to me?"

"Okay, stop. I'm not a cartoon villain." Madison sighed and put her hands on her hips. "I was just trying to wake you up and take you to our very first band practice."

My heart jolted. I looked at my roommate for some sort of comfort but she was sliding out of her bed.

"Awesome, you guys tell me all about it on Monday because I'm going home today."

"Gee whiz, thanks for the support."

Addy laughed. "You don't need me, all you need is your lungs."

Some half hour later, even without having any breakfast first, I somehow found myself jogging on the same treadmill that Ashton used to torture me when we were first meeting after class.

"What the hell is this?" I asked, waving my arms around with what little strength I had left. The band looked at me but offered little sympathy. By the looks on their faces it seemed stranger of me to ask them this question, than it was that all four of them were just casually lounging all around me as I panted and dropped buckets of sweat. "Are you all implying I'm fat and you're not?"

The boys had dragged a mat from the gym and were all sprawled on it. Ashton put his hands behind his head, his eyes glinting in a way that I did not like at all.

"Lift your heels," he said as I made sure that my t-shirt was covering my muffing top. I paused the motion enough to flip him the bird. "Rock 'n roll attitude, I like it."

Link snorted. "I think she's very plainly telling you to fuck off."

"I," I started, and paused so I could gulp in some oxygen. "Am."

Cross legged an arm's length away, Madison looked all around her with her chin resting on her fist. "Okay, so what are we doing here?"

Ashton tore his eyes away from my torture device to look at her. "We're helping Vera to gain some stamina so she can sing for an entire concert."

I gritted my teeth. I wanted to say that I doubted all singers did this, but then again I did remember my ma working out like an athlete when I was young. And she did go on singing for hours.

"Yeah, but after that, what?" she asked. "Do we even have a band name?"

"Casual Friday Funeral," Ash and Link said in unison. I groaned.



"What? It rolls off the tongue," Link said.

The only other person who was also drenched was Quinn. He was still wearing his baseball uniform from this morning's practice, stained with mud front and back. He drank from the biggest water bottle I'd ever seen and did give me something of a pitying look for a quick second. I didn't know if it was caused by my sorry state at the moment or the shitty band name I came up with by accident.

Link took charge then. "We need to establish the direction of our band. What kind of sound do we want? What is the feeling we want to evoke?"

"Feeling?" Madison asked, sweeping her blonde hair back and looking at each of us in turn. "I just thought we were banging at some drums until it sounds cool."

Ashton's blue eyes rolled and fixed on the heavens, or in this case the ceiling. "Music is art, Madison. Did you spend all your visits to the Louvre taking selfies, or actually dissecting the pieces and finding their meaning?"

I lost my footing for a second. "You've been more than once?"

She shrugged. "I thought the montage I made of the Venus de Milo with my arms holding a glass of a champagne and a cigarette was pretty cool. Better than my selfies, even."

That was too much to process for my oxygen deprived brain.

In a fluid motion, Ash sat up and whirled to face her. "Let me paint you this picture. You're at a stadium, waiting for your favorite team to come out — the Knights of Trinity, even. You're waiting for your boyfriend here to come out onto the pitch." We all looked at Quinn then and the guy froze midway while taking his water bottle to his lips. Then Ash continued, "And people suddenly start stomping. There's a rhythm to it that you can recognize. Two stomps, one clap."

"We Will Rock You by Queen," Link said with a nod. "A masterpiece. Simple melody, an ear worm. Gets stuck in your head easily."

"But that's not all." The way Ash spoke was with reverence, like he was at Church and we were his congregation on a Sunday morning. "It's a song that is so engrained into our psyche, generation after generation, that we might as well have been born with the chords entwined in our DNA. When you hear it, your body reacts. You want to join it, keep the music going, escalate that feeling of..."

"Belonging," Link said, a man converted to the cult. "Team."

"It goes way beyond coolness," Ash finished off. "So, again. What kind of feeling do we want to cause?"

Before I was able to stop myself, I rasped out, "Euphoria."

All eyes turned to me. I wished Ash or Lincoln would explain what I meant, but they also waited for me. I had to put the treadmill on pause and chug some water, at which point my stomach croaked in hunger and I felt like if I spoke, more air would come into it and make me fade away. With wobbly legs I walked over and plopped myself down on the mat.

"That," I begun. "Is what I felt at the concert."

"What concert?" Madison asked, but Ash silenced her with a finger to his lips.

"Keep going, V."

"Is there going to be food after this?" I asked.

He smiled. "An all you can eat buffet, on me."

I produced enough mojo to smack him on the leg because the school cafeteria was for free anyway. But I went on. "I mean, even though I was part of the crowd, it felt like I was feeding off of their energy. And imagine just how much greater that feeling would be if we were the ones on stage instead."

"And you only get back what you give," Link added, running his fingers through his long, glossy hair. "So in other words, you want music that is exciting. That makes you feel alive."



Somehow when he said it my entire body got covered in goosebumps.

"Yes."

Ashton's smile touched his eyes and showed all his teeth. "That's a good start."

"Okay, so we play hard and we play fast," Quinn added then. "We're missing something key. What is it that Vera is going to sing?"

"Lyrics." Then Link pulled out a notebook from under him. "I have some ideas."

Ashton folded his arms. "So do I."

"Me too," Madison surprised us by saying. She flashed a brilliant smile. "What? I have a lot of shit to say."

They looked at the other boy and I and we both shook our heads.

Ashton huffed out a breath. He got into a discussion with Link and Madison over whether it'd be best to create music around existing lyrics, provided they passed a test of democracy among the five of us, or the other way around. Or at least that was what my starved, non musician brain could understand.

Quinn cleared his throat until the conversation ground into a halt. "We have another important thing to consider. We'll need practice time."

Oh, yeah. Small detail. All of us safe him were part of the music club, which meant we have a similar schedule that we could work around, but he was on a completely different one. The baseball team seemed to practice every waking moment when it was not away on games. This was going to be tough.

A not so nice smirk drew Ashton's lips up. "So you really think your team stands a chance this year?"

I thought Quinn would get mad or hurt, but instead the same expression appeared on his face. "You asked the same thing last year and we almost won, asshole."

"Dick."

"Turd."

Madison turned her back to them. "Anyway. I suggest we at least meet every weekend."

"I'm totally fine with that," I surprised them all by saying. They didn't know it was because I welcomed more time away from the gringo's house. "As long as I can still get my homework done and ace my assignments."

"Okay, now that we have a plan," Ash said, as if mocking the fact that we, in fact, did not have a plan. He shimmied his hips until he was able to pull a piece of paper out from his back pocket. Then he unfolded it and slammed it in between all of us. "We can start preparing for this."

Central Florida Battle of the New Bands .

Central Florida Battle of the New Bands It was as if the air was sucked out of the room and none of us could breathe. Like a murder of crows, we descended on the paper like it was a piece of meat.

November 22nd.

November 22nd. Open to all new bands who think they can make it.

Open to all new bands who think they can make it. 1st Prize: Contract with a record label.

1st Prize: Contract with a record label. 2nd Prize: Demo session AND pitch with a record label.

2nd Prize: Demo session AND pitch with a record label. 3rd Prize: Professional demo recording session.

3rd Prize: Professional demo recording session. Sponsored by a local rock radio station that would play all winners songs after the show.

"Hell yeah!" Link's scream had me jumping out of my skin. "We're doing this!"

"Holy..." Quinn wasn't able to even finish his sentence.

Madison leaned back. "So you never gave up on your dream, huh?"

"Never," Ash admitted. "It's just that now we do stand a chance."

They'd probably talked about this before the whole drama went down, especially since all three of them used to play together.

But now I was involved, too.

Slowly I lifted my eyes. "Do you think we could even get third?"

"Third?" Ash put his hands on his chest in offense. And then he leaned forward, closer to me, his face morphing into that look of a hungry hunter. He said, "I think we can get first."

In retrospective, that was probably the moment it all changed for us, and these five freaks dared to spread their wings and fly.

I had to put on the brakes at the very last second to avoid colliding with Mother Superior Evangeline. While I felt like I'd just had a heart attack, she looked at me with her usual expression that was a cross between a resting bitch face and acceptance of fate. I knew it was wrong to think of a nun in those terms, but I couldn't help myself.

"I'm sorry," I said, panting.

Her eyes narrowed ever so slightly. "Were you running in the hallways?"

I was panting. Half of my face was covered with hair that had escaped my pony tail. I held a binder that was falling to the brink with scribbled on papers. Papers that didn't contain any homework.

I couldn't look guiltier.

"Running to meet your expectations, ma'am." I felt my face burn. Like the flames of hell were licking closer to my skin for having said that. Yet, I pressed on. "The shorter my commute, the better I can use my time to not let you down."

She snorted and shook her head. "Too much internet seems to give kids these days an answer for everything."

I flashed all my teeth into as wide a smile as I could manage. "Does that mean I can go?"

"Sure," she said, and my feet pivoted away from her. But she stopped me next by saying, "Before you go, answer this one question for me, Vera."

A myriad of scenarios passed before my eyes. In one, she asked me if I was focusing on my studies. The answer was, nowhere near as much as I thought I would. In another one, she asked me if anyone was giving me any trouble. I'd give her a whole laundry list for an answer, starting by a certain boy whose last name evoked the coldest season, yet, whose eyes were as warm as the summer ocean.

Yes, lots of trouble.

I squirmed as she asked, "Are you enjoying music?"

That was unexpected.

I blinked. My mouth opened, as if about to tell her everything that had happened in the past few months. I only realized it much later, after I kept running to the music room and burst through the open door that I'd said yes with a wide smile from ear to ear that for sure had shown my dimples.

Ashton looked up from tuning his guitar and saw me come in.

He lit up. It came from somewhere within him and spilled all the way out from his body. He sat straighter, matched my smile and set his eyes on mine with no hesitation.

"Thanks for coming in early," he said.

Yes, okay. I wasn't precisely running over to put my new jogging skills to the test. He called me and asked to meet him before band practice, said he wanted to show me something. I fixed up my hair as best as I could with an elastic band that was so stretched out, it could barely hold my endless bushy hair, and glided over to sit next to him as he patted the empty chair.



"Did you do your homework?"

I answered his question by pointing at the binder full of loose sheets of paper. I'd been so far removed from any kind of rock for my entire life that I had a lot to catch up with. My new homework had been to study some classics. Ash and Link gave me some recommendations but encouraged me to find other bands outside of those, and tell them what I liked best. I spent about a week stuck at '60s and '70s classics until I whined and moaned to them that I really didn't like those. This almost gave them strokes, but they let me move on to the following decades. My favorite so far were late '90s and 2000s. I could definitely identify with the general notions of not belonging, wanting something else, being mad at the status quo.

And so as I listened to the songs, I began to daydream. Wouldn't it be nice if I could tell the world how I felt? Inadequate, small in the ways that mattered, big in the ways that shouldn't. Like I didn't matter.

I slid a glance next to me as he found something on his computer. Well, I did matter to a few people. I wondered if he really was one of them.

"Give me your best one."

He extended his hand and waited for me to place a paper on top. But I couldn't decide, because I was sure none of them were any good.

"Um." I rummaged through the pages of notes that made some sense at times and none at others. I glanced up for a quick second and his eyebrows were raised up in a challenge. In a panic, I wondered if these notes would sound like straight up amalgams of the songs I listened to for inspiration. Or if any of this would be useful for writing an actual original song that made people's blood boil, starting by mine first.

He nudged me with his shoulder. "How about that one? The one you just passed."

What he pointed at was probably the one with the most scratches and scribbles. "Why that one?"

"Looks like it gave you trouble but you stuck to it, because you kept changing it. You wouldn't let it go." My heart leapt to my throat as he smiled at me, so close that I could feel the heat radiate off of his body and start to melt mine. "It probably has the most heart out of all of them."

I plucked the paper and handed it to him, clearing my throat as if that could do away with the sudden tension that set itself in my muscles, and could only be alleviated by molding my body against his. I had to remind myself that I had to be firm, that this infatuation he thought he had was just caused by the effect of music. That that was not enough to bring us closer in a genuine way.

He tore his eyes away from me and read the song. I couldn't help but watch him like a hawk, waiting for any reaction that my short little poem, of sorts, was a fresh steaming pile of horse shit.

Ash set the paper in front of him. "I like it," he said, to my shock. "Let's work with it. What's the vibe you want for this song?"

I thought about it. "Liberating."

I never admitted it to anybody, but this song was about my ma. It might've sounded like it was about a lover to anybody else, but to me it was all about letting go of what had been my mission for the past 17 years of my life: making her happy.

He licked his lips and his eyes strayed down to mine. I felt them itch, as if they wanted to be ready in case he leaned in. And he was just close enough that he could snatch a kiss if he wanted to. But he looked back into my eyes as he asked, "What do you want to feel free from?"

I was stunned when my first thought was, that right then I wanted to be free off our clothes. My mind cleared off of any other reason than that, but I was saved just before it got too awkward. The other guys strolled in then, and I was both relieved and disappointed to miss wherever this had been headed. Madison strutted over like she was on a catwalk, snatched up the piece of paper from us and whistled low.

"Oh, a breakup song. I like it." She slid a sly look my way. "Got your heart broken recently, huh?"

Not really. Ashton may have momentarily shut my brain down with his proximity, but the reason why this song came to be was very much under the surface of my skin.

My heart just had been continually broken by my ma's disappointment in me.

I shrugged at her.

Lincoln took the paper from her hands and read the thing aloud.

I'm at the cusp of a change

I'm at the cusp of a change A feeling that won't go away

A feeling that won't go away Like I've realized

Like I've realized It wasn't me

It wasn't me It was you

It was you All along

All along Like I've realized

Like I've realized It's time to say...

It's time to say... Goodbye

Goodbye I got the future

I got the future On the tip of my tongue

On the tip of my tongue When I say

When I say Goodbye

Goodbye Goodbye

Goodbye I just wish you'd have become

I just wish you'd have become My favorite regret

My favorite regret Goodbye

Goodbye And

And I

I Wonder

Wonder How you run away and never leave

How you run away and never leave You miss the train but are still here

You miss the train but are still here As if you want to stay

As if you want to stay And never let me free

And never let me free But I've realized

But I've realized It's time to say...

It's time to say... I'd been ready for some heavy duty side eye but he nodded like he'd seen worse.

"Not bad, we can add more meat to it."

"Okay, let's do this," Quinn said, rubbing his hands together. His arm muscles bulged with the motion and I wondered if he'd got them mostly out of playing baseball or the drums. "I gotta go meet with the team before dinnertime."

We all sat around Ash so that we could build some sort of melody before giving it a try playing it. Quinn missed his appointment, because two hours later, well into dinnertime, we took our positions. I grabbed the microphone and faced the empty chairs in the music room. Then a vertigo-inducing cacophony of sounds exploded from us.

And that was how we started writing our first song together.

♪ Getting Away With It ♪

Friday night I stood in front of 200 people, frozen like I'd just looked into Medusa's eyes. Admittedly, though I'd been turned to stone my heart was beating with loud thumps that almost hurt. I could feel it on my temples, which were also dripping cold sweat.

How did I even dream I could possibly do this?

The orchestra was setting up in front of me, and more people kept arriving into the bleachers. Our team and the guys from Metropolitan High School were warming up behind me. Even above the loud chatter of people, the out of tune orchestra, the athletes shouting instructions and even the sounds of the night, the distance noise of cars in traffic, I could hear the sound of my heart in my ears. I looked down at my hands and they were shaking.

In a few minutes I was supposed to sing the national anthem. My mind helpfully provided examples of celebrity blunders as they sang the most important song in the land in front of large audiences, broadcasted live on TV, and completely fucked it up.

Oh God, I couldn't remember the lyrics.

"You look like you're freaking out right now."

I looked up at the source of the voice and found Madison standing before me with her violin.

"I'm going to give you a little trick," she said.

"If it's to imagine that everybody is naked, that doesn't work. I did that once during a school presentation," I added, grimacing at the memory. "Somehow I ended up looking down at myself and imagining that I was the one who was naked."

She laughed. "Alright, but see that guy over there?"

I followed where she was pointing and asked, "Ashton?"

"Imagine him naked."

him I gasped and she left me standing there, frozen once more but for a different reason. Because now that she'd put the image in my head I couldn't unsee it, even though I was sure my imagination didn't do the real thing justice. But, of course, I was never going to see the real thing. Because that would mean he'd also see my thing, and I couldn't let that happen. I had more fat rolls when looked at up close and undressed.

I could feel my face and mood turning sour all of a sudden. It was why I was sure that there was no way he was really into me. It was all because of my singing. It was the only thing I could do well.

I took a deep breath and focused on that. This one thing I could. Sing as if I didn't care if I had no voice left tomorrow.

I squared up my shoulders and told everybody I was ready, even before Sister Louisa got into position. The crowd was instructed to stand for the national anthem, and the music begun soon after. I gave it my all, in my mind telling Christina Aguilera to suck it.



My face throbbed when I released the last note. If it was because of the effort, I didn't know. But there was a lot of clapping going on and I felt like that was contributing to it.

As we climbed down from the makeshift stage, I felt somebody bump my shoulder. Madison wiggled her perfect eyebrows, straight from a Vogue cover. "See? Told you it'd work."

"That what would work?"

I startled as Ashton appeared next to us. He looked as if it were suspicious as hell that Madison and I were hanging out together. And it was. But one way or another, she'd been right more times than I cared to admit.

I ducked my head as we climbed up the bleachers to watch the game and said to her, "Yeah, I guess it did."

"Are you blushing?" She cooed in a way that made me curl up into my shell. "Oh my goodness, you are. Are you a virgin?"

It was Ashton who screamed. "A what?"

My mouth was just hanging open. She hoisted the strap of her violin case up onto her shoulder and held my eyes. Hers twinkling like she was looking into a spotlight — the one that was on my head. "Why don't we sit together so I can give you some tips?" Her eyes slid to her ex for a second. "Because he does bite, you know."

"Madison!"

That was him. I just yelped and bypassed them as quick as I could to join Addy. Her mouth was stuffed with popcorn when I joined her. She gulped down half of her soda to wash it all down and said, "That was incredible but why do you look like you're about to cry?"

"I just got outed by Madison in front of Ash for being a virgin."

"How'd she know?" was her question.

I narrowed my eyes at her. "Why do you not sound shocked? Do I give off a whiff of au de untouched maiden?"

Addy smiled and sipped more soda. "So you are."

I rolled my eyes and mumbled a yes.

"See, I didn't know. I took a wild guess and your reaction told me everything."

I smacked her hard on the shoulder and wished that we could just focus on the game. It was supposed to be the make or break game before going to district, but a moment later I heard familiar voices behind us.

"What are you trying here, Madison?" My skin broke into goosebumps as Ashton's voice came from directly behind me. I twisted around to see him glaring at his ex. Meanwhile, she was the picture of innocence.

"Just trying out this new friendship thing." She shrugged a delicate shoulder that could easily shoulder a heavy bass. "I figure if we're going to be a band together, we need to be a team. Get to know each other and all that." She tilted her head toward me. "I was just trying to get to know our front woman."

"Front woman," I said, marvel laced in my voice. "I'm a front woman?"

"Absolutely," Addy chirped.

Ashton's eyes rolled so hard he must have made himself dizzy. "Yeah, well, you don't get to know someone by asking them things they may not want to answer."

"Okay, fine." She rested her chin against her fist as she gazed up at him with a whole hell of a defiant look. "Then you answer me this. When you kissed her a while back, was that for real or just to try to make me jealous?"

Addy guffawed, her popcorn spilling everywhere without her bothering to care about it. "This is way better than the game."

To me, the game, anything around me, was way better than this conversation. I picked out Quinn on the field easily. The only black boy from our team. He was dashing between bases but they tagged him out. Link chose that moment to join us, carrying the biggest basket of popcorn I'd ever seen in my life. He was a noodle type of guy, very tall and slim, and I couldn't make out where he'd stuff all of that.



Then Ashton's voice came. "It was for real."

Two gasps followed. I was sure Addy and Madison had the same look on their faces.

I plunged my hand in Link's popcorn and he protested, trying to take it away from me.

"What the hell? Get your own," as he said this he buried his face in the popcorn. Munching, he asked, "So what's going on?"

Before anybody answered, I chimed in with, "We're losing."

"Great, that way our drummer will have more time to practice with us," Link said.

Said drummer's girlfriend reached over Ashton and me to whack the Asian American boy up the head. "Yeah, but losing tonight's game might make it harder for him to get a good college scholarship, idiot."

I swiveled around. "Scholarship? Why would he need one?"

Weren't all kids here filthy rich, except for me?

She was serious for once. "He's on a scholarship like you, virgin girl."

"You're a virgin?"

I elbowed Lincoln so hard in the ribs I might have broken one, but it was well deserved after he screamed it so loud that half of the stands turned my way. Now my face and my entire body were burning with pure embarrassment.

"Changing topic before I get smacked to death by the fiery Latina here," Link said, coming to the rescue now. I turned my nose up for good measure. "Did you all get my text earlier today?"

"Yeah," Madison replied. "But how are we doing this? We can't cram all our instruments into Ashton's Jeep, and I'd rather not call any of my servants for help because they'll run and tell my mom. You know how much she hates it when I don't do lady like things."

Ash clapped once and rubbed his hands. I caught his smile from the corner of my eyes and ducked my head, overwhelmed by what I saw in his face. A lot of light and the desire to live and cause damage. I wasn't sure I was ready for all that. "Don't worry, fam, I got you."

We ended up losing, and I felt pretty bad for Quinn. I hadn't even known that he was like me. No one had mentioned that he was also on a scholarship and I'd always thought his name was posh as hell. I didn't know if his home situation was better or worse than what I'd grown up with, if it allowed him to have a plan b. I figured he'd be pretty disappointed and maybe even mad after tonight. Maybe as a result we wouldn't be able to follow through with the plan.

About an hour later he met us at the cafeteria, all dressed up in casual clothes to match ours.

And he was smiling.

"Are we ready?"

Ash stood up and for the first time since I knew them, they shook hands. It felt like more than just a, I'm sorry you lost your game.

It looked like maybe they'd already made up.

I looked back at Madison and her face was a work of art. Frozen in a moment of relief and joy.

Well, okay. This was good and probably long coming, but why was Quinn so happy?

"If by that you mean ready to let my anger out by smashing some drums, then fuck yeah."

"Good," Link said, tucking his thumbs into the belt loops of his jeans. "But how are we getting out of here? May I remind everybody that as long as we're not picked up by our legal guardians outside of weekends and holidays, we're under curfew at the school."

Ash put a hand to his chest, as if it hurt. "You dare to doubt me?"

And maybe we shouldn't have.



It turned out that rich people definitely had their ways. The first step in his plan was for all of us to sneak out of school. When I asked how, he replied, "Remember all that training I've had you do for the past couple of months? Well, the time has come to use it."

All six of us, including Addy who never wanted to miss out on the fun, sneaked out of the building under the cover of the night and the thick canopies of the trees. Ash guided us through a pitch black patch of forest, the area where I first saw him, actually, which was terrifying for me because my feet kept snagging on tree roots on the ground. It took us forever to reach the end and stand face to face with a crude chainlink fence.

He pointed at it like it was actually an open door. "And then we climb it."

I gasped and was about to scream bloody murder when Addy asked, "Wait. I see that nobody's carrying their instruments. Won't they need those?"

Ashton did a flourish with his hand. "Like I said, trust me."

Quinn's teeth flashed bright in the dark. "It's not our first rodeo."

One by one they started climbing until it was only me left. And Ash.

"You got this," he said. As if.

"Um, may I remind you that all I've done for the past few weeks is running? I've had no wall climbing training!"

He laughed softly. I felt his hand on my elbow, burning my skin even as he gently guided me. "Do you trust me?"

I swallowed thickly. "I think I do, even though I don't honestly know why."

"Okay, let me prove it. Start climbing, I'll help you."

I squared myself in front of him. "You don't get it. What if... what if my weight brings the fence down?"

Link, ever so helpful, said, "That'd be hilarious."

"Shut up, they're having a moment." That was Madison.

My head spun as he took a step closer and looked down into my eyes, so deep that I felt like I was drowning in his. It didn't matter that there were other eyes on us, or that we might get caught by the nuns for trying to sneak out and possibly face a terrible punishment. At that second all that mattered to me was that yes, I was a fucking virgin, but I'd devour him if he let me.

"Do you want me to make you shine?" he asked, his gravel voice so low that it sent a shudder down my spine. "Do you want to sing?"

"I," I started. Then with a deep breath I finished, "I do."

The guys hollered on the other side of the fence. I turned to it and wedged my foot in, and then I felt Ashton's hands around my waist as I tried to climb. I could feel that he was putting as much effort into supporting me as my limbs did. By the time I reached the top, he gave me a hearty push from my butt that made me squeal, because it both sent me over the edge of the fence and over the edge of my sanity. And then for a hot second I was stunned speechless, because he picked me up on the other side.

"What?" I asked, turning back to see Ash climbing behind me. And then it dawned on me. "Oh, hey, Ayrton. I didn't know you were joining us."

"And miss the official debut of the Casual Friday Funeral? Never."

The twin helped me straighten up as his older brother landed and said, "Ta da."

My eyes followed to where he pointed. A super creepy, beat down van that looked like It could live inside.

It "Please, step into my office," Ayrton said, opening the back door to the van where we saw Quinn's drums, amps, guitar and base and all sorts of weird things that belonged to Link with still a surprising amount of extra space. "Are you ready?"

A chorus of hell yeahs answered him. And so we drove off to a college party around the UCF area, where we were going to play our songs to an audience for the first time.

Without knowing that shit was going to hit the proverbial fan and smear us all.

♪ With Lungs Wide Open ♪

The last time I'd been to a party had been momentous. I'd walked in a girl with made up insecurities and had come out with all of them confirmed by a failed encounter with a boy.

Only Leti, DeAndre, that boy and I knew what had happened. I'd come out of the room crying and found my friends, who jumped to conclusions that what had happened had been even worse than it was. DeAndre had got into an argument with the boy as Leti and I bundled into an Uber and went home, and although I never knew what exactly happened after we left, I did notice that he stopped hanging out with us.

Leti had tried and failed to get me to join her at parties after that. Although I didn't think about that boy often, I did often get swallowed up by the effect that night had on me.

I found my two friends from the barrio when we made it to the house party. I made eye contact with DeAndre as he danced with Leti in the crowd to a song by Nicki Minaj. My best friend had invited herself and dragged him along tonight for the great debut of my band. It only helped to lay the pressure on thicker on me.

He stopped swaying to the music and grabbed Leti by the hand, pulling her to come over. I still found him one of the most attractive boys I'd ever met, and judging by the way he made heads turn as he approached, I wasn't the only one, but talking to him didn't make me nervous anymore.

This whole rock band thing did.

"Are you ready, perra?" Leti asked me with a grin, her voice high over the noise inside the party house. "Show them all some Latin screamo."

I choked. "That is the strangest concept."

"But isn't it true?" she asked, shrugging. "You guys are not a conventional rock band made out of white guys from the Midwest."

The much was true. I turned back around and saw Lincoln Choi testing his DJ console, a rich Asian American with an online following who seemed to think that we were a solid next step. Then there was Madison Hollingsworth, a rich girl violinist who turned into a different person when the music started playing, tuning her bass as she chatted with her boyfriend Quinn Montgomery, a black boy on a baseball scholarship at a prestigious school that had learned to play the drums so that he could hang out with his rich white friend, Ashton Winters, who stood a few paces away from me plugging his guitar into an amp, chatting it up with his gay twin brother, Ayrton Winters, who'd brought a camera to record our performance next to Adele Holt, who in a short time had designed some merchandise for our newborn band and was trying to sell it among the crowd.

I couldn't help but think they were all so extraordinary that it made me wonder what in the hell I was doing there with them, but then I thought about it objectively.

Finally there was me, Vera Maria de la Cruz Vazquez, born from a failed entertainer. I didn't want to let them down. Not the guys in the band or the ones who were giving us so much support.



I grabbed the mic and asked my friends, "Ready?"

Among various affirmations it was Ashton's that struck a chord with me. He said, "I've been waiting my entire life for this."

So had I.

I turned on the mic. Even though there was no spotlight in the living room of this house, with all eyes suddenly on me it felt like I was on a stage. My very first one.

My normal reaction would have been to break into a cold sweat and freeze. To be caught up between my desire to glow and my fear of being at the forefront of things. But everything in my life had lead me here and maybe it was conquering my fear of what I could accomplish what would get me away from the complications of my ma.

Once I realized this, something amazing happened. I disconnected from myself.

My hand gripped the microphone harder and I spoke into it. "Thank you to the Beta Gamma Epsilons for having us tonight. We are Casual Friday Funeral and we're here to rock your brains off."

The lukewarm response to that brought a smile to my face. I had trust in my friends that we'd wake them up.

Quinn clicked his sticks, one, two, three.

I had a moment to enjoy the crowd's reaction as Madison strutted forward, making her bass squeal like it was a guitar with a personal message to everybody listening. A few of the guys at the front took notice of her and I knew they were hooked even before the rest of us started.

The music was as if an explosion was coming right from behind me and I'd become part of the shrapnel. I grabbed the microphone and let loose as though I was on a mission to pierce each and every ear in the room. I closed my eyes, not knowing what happened to me for the next few minutes. I was one with the music, my body moving in its own accord. One moment my back was against Madison's, the next I was facing Ashton as he tore at his guitar. His body barely seemed to contain the energy it stored. His head was thrown back as he stroked the strings like he was alone in his room and it wasn't music he was playing.

I swiveled around letting the music take me back to the front, up against the crowd. My hair bounced on my face as I sang, but I could still see the party goers in front of me. I stumbled upon the lyrics for a second because I was grinning so hard that although they didn't know us, or our music, we'd made them react. This crowd of mostly college kids were hollering and jumping as our music resonated with the pumping of their blood. I threw my head back and let the last note go, a mix between a scream and a growl that hadn't been part of the rehearsals but came from deep within my soul.

After our agreed upon half an hour on the stage was done, I was damn sure I was not the same Vera that walked into this party. Like with the last party, I was changed.

I didn't know how many people were in the house, but it sounded like it was coming down in a flurry of screaming and clapping. I wondered if this was what finishing a concert felt like. I was sweating more than when I ran on the treadmill. My throat felt raw, my heart was leaping right out of it. But my face hurt from smiling so hard.

I was nearly knocked off my feet as someone hugged me from behind, and then someone else. It took me a second to register that it was the guys from the band. We all huddled in the middle of the makeshift stage, hugging each other and jumping awkwardly, stepping on each other's toes. But it didn't matter. This was what true happiness felt like. It was heady and completely new to me. I could get addicted to it.

When we pulled away I found myself face to face with Ash. His face was dripping with sweat and his grey t-shirt was glued to his chest and despite the noise all around us I could make out that he said thank you .

thank you

I grabbed his face and pulled him down to my level. My eyes rested on his for a second, waiting for a sign. I got it as soon as his cast down on my lips. These past few months I'd learned that there was blessing to be had in doing what your heart was set out on. That not everything was out of reach. I'd lived my entire life hoping to please others, and that hadn't really got me a whole lot of good for myself. But this summer I decided I had to do me and I'd never been happier.

People could say I, the daughter of an immigrant, a woman who'd gone from dreaming of the stars to cleaning bathrooms, that I, a fat girl with brown skin and kinky, unruly hair, without a father and without enough money to fall dead, couldn't sing or dance or be happy in the arms of a pretty boy.

So fuck it.

I kissed Ashton like nobody was watching. Like it didn't matter one whit what our parents would say, what the whole school would say. Like all the restrictions I'd put upon myself for the past few months, years even, were suddenly turned to dust. His arms came around my waist and he brought me flush against him. My body flared to life, like all of it was a heart that throbbed because of him. I felt him push my hair away and hold the side of my face as my jaw worked at nibbling his lips. He tilted my head back and deepened the kiss like it'd been his idea all along. I tasted the same urgency, the same hunger I felt, in his tongue. It swept almost delicately across my lips at first, but mine met it half way and then we were lost. My fingers ran through his hair and brought him closer. I didn't want this moment to end.

We finally pulled away, panting, eyes wide like people who'd had the first taste of food after starving.

There was a whistle next to us. "Hot, damn. For a second there I wondered if you both were professional swimmers or something, I'd never seen anyone hold their breath for so long."

I turned slowly to see Ayrton filming us with his camera and nearly jumped out of my skin. Ash put his hand on the camera and turned it away.

"A moment, please?" he said.

Ayrton smirked. "I'll give you two, how about that?"

My jaw was hanging open as Ash turned back to face me, his tongue tucked against his cheek. His hands were still on my waist and it didn't seem like he wanted to let go any time soon.

"Well, I'm definitely not complaining but what was that?"

I shrugged and realized my fingers were still tangled in his hair. Slowly I brought my hands down to his shoulders. The brief caress made his eyes darken and his hold tighten. I liked it. I liked having this effect on him. It was almost as good as sharing the stage with him.

"I just kinda think it's time for me to stop being such a coward," I said, trying not to get distracted by how he licked his lips. "I've lived in fear of everything for too long. Fear of what I want, of what happens if I get it or if I don't, and of what people would say. I'm sick and tired of it."

His lips stretched into a smile. "That's exactly what I like about you."

My eyes went wide as saucers. "What?"

"We're all afraid Vera, I'm not the exception and neither are you." One of his hands pushed away a strand of curls that had fallen on my forehead. He swept it back so lovingly that I felt it in my toes. His eyes sought mine again, the digits of his fingers trailing down my cheek and to my chin. "I've seen you make the choice between fear and bravery, over and over. I've admired you for it from the start and I wish I could be more like you."

I struggled with putting thoughts into a coherent string after that. One way or another, he'd been the one who had inspired me to take risks. What was he talking about?

And then we heard it. The moment was shattered by a curse that came accompanied by genuine terror. And someone screamed, "The cops are here!"

That was not the kind of thing I expected to hear at a party full of white people. Yet, it had never really happened at parties in my barrio. Although a few of those had turned out rowdier than was acceptable, it seemed like nobody had given enough of a damn to call the cops. Years of living among people who didn't have all their papers, skirted a fine line between what was legal and not, or simply had skin that was considered too dark to be innocent, had trained me to keep my head and hair under the radar. I had a lot more riding on being well behaved than probably anybody else in this room. Except Quinn.

He and I looked at each other, the same type of horror written on his face.

I jumped to action. I grabbed Ash's hand and tugged at him. Thank goodness he followed without resisting. I screamed for Leti and DeAndre and was glad when they appeared with Addy. I looked around me and saw that Ayrton was just behind us, with Link and Madison. That was all the people I cared about together.

Good.

But then there was a stream of people stumbling over each other to make it out of the single door at the entrance of the house. Just behind where we'd been playing there was a huge window. "Follow me," I told them.

They dashed to it behind me. We pulled it open and jumped out of it, falling on the other side onto the grass in a single heap. I saw a couple run by us, a tall dark haired boy pushing a redhead girl in front of him, as if he didn't dare lose sight of her for a second.

I felt somebody pull me up and saw DeAndre. If we got caught, he could also lose his promising modeling career.

"We have to get the hell out of dodge," he said.

"What about your instruments?" Addy asked, eyes wide like she couldn't believe what was happening.

"We're more important," Ashton said. He grabbed my hand, even though his eyes were trained on DeAndre's face. "I'll take care of her."

My friend's lips pulled back into a snarl. "I'm sure you will, white boy. You're invisible to the cops."

I gasped.

"Okay, we don't have time for this shit." Leti pushed them away from each other. "We need to fucking run."

So run we did, straight out into the street. I clenched my hand tight around Ashton's and was glad that he didn't let me go. We all veered left, away from the house following Ayr. He'd parked the van by himself after we'd off loaded the instruments into the house. I tried to focus on his back as he ran ahead of us, not on the instruments we'd left behind that surely cost more money than what my ma made in a year, or on what could happen.

We almost crashed into each other, braking into a halt. A scream escaped my throat as Ayrton narrowly avoided being ran over by a patrol car that suddenly appeared in front of us, blocking our path.



In a panic, Ayrton turned around, screaming at us to run, but we were blocked on the other side by a policeman in a motorcycle.

The latter screamed at us, "Freeze right there. Put your hands up in the air!"

Oh shit.

I froze and seemed unable to follow instructions. I just couldn't believe this was happening. He repeated his demand and I was only able to comply when Ashton let my hand go and whispered at me to do as he said.

My heart broke as I saw Quinn and DeAndre ahead of me, their hands raised higher than the rest of us, their large, muscled limbs trembling as their hearts pumped terror directly into their veins. I prayed for us, prayed true like I had never.

Hindsight was 20/20, and in retrospective I could see that we were so lucky that all that happened was that we got patted down and bundled into police cars. It could've been so much worse. Especially for the boys.

It felt like ages after we got tested for alcohol, got processed and locked in a cell with a few other kids from the party who did look like they'd taken copious amounts of something. I was crying by that point like my eyes were faucets that were broken and wouldn't close off the stream. I was sure I was going to get kicked out of school. I was sure that with this on my record I'd never be admitted to a decent college, never get a well paying job. A short moment of bliss, of freedom, of doing the only thing I was really good at, had just ruined my entire fucking life.

I felt arms come around me, and when I realized it was Ashton I pushed him away and didn't dare to look at him.

"Leave her alone, you stupid, privileged asshole."

My body stiffened. Slowly I looked up. Ashton looked like he'd been punched by DeAndre's words, even though he stood three paces away on the opposite corner of the cell, which was now full of as much tension as it was of people.

"What the fuck," Ashton said, not really as a question. "What's your problem, dude?"

"My problem is you. You're the reason we're all here," DeAndre said.

I shook my head a few times, trying in vain to grasp at the reasons why this was happening.

"You're the one who planned this gig with a college frat," he continued, pointing at Ashton. "You made this happen."

"Are you saying I called the cops on us?" Ashton snorted. "And what? Get myself in as much trouble as you're in?"

"Ash, stop," I said, getting in between them. I cringed at the hurt on his face. "Shut up, please."

"Why?" he asked softly. "Are you on his side?"

"On this, yeah." I sniffed, but it didn't stop my tears from falling as any attempt for the past hour. "You don't have anywhere near as much to lose from this as we do. Your dad will come and rescue you with all his money and power, and we don't have that. Our futures-" My voice broke for a second, but I pushed on. "Our futures might just be fucked because of tonight."

He took a step back, dropping his face in his hands. Ayrton glared at me for the first time since I'd met him. I hadn't thought he'd be capable of hostility.

He said, "Clearly you don't know our father very well."

It was silent after that. I shuddered, realizing that I was in the middle of an argument that no one was going to win. I walked over to Leti and Addy and sat between them, facing Madison as she rubbed Quinn's back. We stayed like that for what felt like an hour, watching as the cops brought more people from the party into the precinct. I didn't understand why a college party had been such a big deal for them until I caught whiff of the words drug bust and underage drinking at the same time. I hugged my knees against my chest and cried into the fabric of my jeans.



Tonight was a nightmare.

"There you are."

I vaguely recognized the voice in the back of my head. I looked up to find the Winters boys' father stand just outside the cell with a couple of men. One of them carried a suitcase and I assumed it was the family lawyer.

His eyes were cold as they swept over all of us. They didn't light up in recognition as he saw me. Instead, they posed on his sons with burning intensity. Both boys squared up in front of him, blocking him form our view.

"Father," Ashton said, his voice so deep and dark that it raised goosebumps on my skin. "What are you doing here?"

"Saving the family name from further ruin," the older man said. "It's not enough that your brother comes out as gay and puts shame on our family's Christian values, but now you drag him and you into jail? And here I had hope on you, Ashton."

Ayrton laughed. "Somehow we're worse than you being a lap dog to politicians more corrupt even than you? Or than our drunk off her ass mother?"

My eyes widened.

I didn't know these things. Ashton never said anything.

The Senator snapped. "Shut up, I'm not talking to you."

The lawyer cleared his throat. "Um, excuse me, sir. This is not the best place to have this kind of discussion."

The Senator looked around at the many eyes on him and adjusted his tie. "Right."

"Well, I have good news." The lawyer pushed his glasses up his nose. "I checked with the law enforcement and none of you have been pressed any charges, since your tests have come out clean. We've made sure your records will stay clear; after all it isn't illegal to attend a party while being a minor, as long as there is no consumption of alcohol or illicit substances. You just need to be picked up by your legal guardians."

We all looked at each other, wondering if we were hearing straight. Quinn, especially, was reluctant to believe it.

"How's this possible? I thought we were in trouble," he said.

The Senator looked him up and down. "Not this time, Montgomery. Although this could become a pattern."

Everybody jumped out of their skin as I started laughing. I slowly made my way up, my chest bubbling with dark amusement. I stood in between his sons and looked up at his face.

"We meet again, sir," I said, smiling even though I didn't mean it. "I'm sure you're expecting us to fall over our faces in gratitude for your help, and don't get me wrong, I am thankful — for your lawyer. You?" I tilted my head with a frown. "You've disappointed me. I thought a man like you was supposed to be a servant of the people, not a bully to his own flesh and blood. Or that you'd dare imply that we'll keep getting in trouble. Why?" I asked him, narrowing my eyes. "Because we're not in the same social circles as you? Or is it something else?"

I felt a hand on my shoulder. Ashton's.

I grabbed it and pulled it down so that I could hold it in mine. The Senator's eyes caught the action.

"Young lady," the man positively growled. "I don't appreciate being spoken to in this matter. Especially after I'm here to help you, all of you."

I smiled wider. "And I'll for sure keep that in mind when I become your constituent in less than a year, sir."

Ashton squeezed my hand.

With one last glance at his sons, the Senator turned around and barked at the men around us to hold all of us until the morning. So that we'd learn our lesson, he said. Although I didn't know what that was supposed to mean.

I took a deep breath and said, "Your dad's a dick, guys."

The twins said in unison, "Yeah."

"Okay," Link piped in for the first time since we'd been apprehended, without any of his usual fuckery. "We won't have any criminal records thanks to your dick of a dad. Great. But who's calling their parents? Because I don't know if you've noticed, but my parents live in Korea, and a stint in jail isn't precisely in their long list of things for me to do."

We all looked at each other.

"I don't know about you," I said. "But if my ma catches wind of this I'll be a goner."

"Same," Leti said. "My mama will kill me with her chancla."

DeAndre lifted his hands. "Don't look at me. My dad enjoys a good belt whipping."

Madison tossed her hair back. "My parents are in Paris right now."

Of course.

Addy sighed. "Mine in the Seychelles trying to save their marriage."

That pretty much left Quinn.

"Y'all," he said in a panic. "My mom is a black woman, do you not know what that means?"

We all found out well after midnight. Quinn's mom signed us all out and spent a solid half hour screaming us deaf. Even the cops who got us in this mess in the first place, seemed to suffer from a decent amount of pity.

And then Quinn's mom said something that made us all freeze, "You think I'm bad? Just you wait until the school finds out where you spent your Friday night after curfew."

We were pretty much fucked.

♪ Must Stop ♪

Quinn's mom looked about half his size but twice his might, which had the interesting effect of reducing us all to half our age.

"I didn't raise y'all," she said as she pointed at us, and then pivoted around to face her son. "But you, you I did. And I've told you a million times that if you want a better life than what your dad and I have had, you need to be better than anybody else. That includes no visits to jail!"

He flinched, and so did the rest of us.

"Yes, mom."

"You are lucky that your friend's father is a good man and got you all out of that place without a blimp in your records but Lord help me, that's one too many scares for my poor heart. You hear me?"

"Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry."

"We're sorry, Mrs. Montgomery," Ashton said, hanging his head. "It won't happen again."

She harrumphed and didn't continue the speech, like she'd already lost steam. We stood outside of the precinct, waiting for Jem to arrive. The twins' aunt was in town, having driven over from Sarasota with Ayrton and she'd been the one the boys called as soon as our belongings were returned to us. She was picking up the van and driving it over to take us back to the school.

What a fiasco.

I kicked a pebble and looked down at my scribbled on sneakers. Was this what happened when I had fun? If so, I was ready for a life of routine and zero excitement.

Someone slung an arm around my shoulders and I looked up to Leti's grin. I grimaced in response.

"Why do you look so happy?"

She shrugged. "I'm used to being a bit of a troublemaker, tú sabes? So I'm kind of proud that you also have it in you."

I rolled my eyes. "Well, I'm not."

Jem arrived not long after with a grim line on her lips. She parked the van by the curb and got out. When I met her she'd seemed so carefree and full of life, but I could tell by the look in her eyes that we were in for another lecture the entire way back to school. We thanked Mrs. Montgomery before filing into the van. Just before her son did, though, she pulled him back and caught him in a hug. From my vantage, I could see as Quinn's face morphed into shock, but his arms came slowly about her small frame and returned the affection. I could imagine how scared she'd been when she got his call. I looked away and decided to stop that train of thought before my mood got any worse. I hopped into the van and noticed that all our instruments were in it. Clearly Jem had rescued them, too.

A few minutes into the drive, Jem sighed really loud. The twins said in unison, "I'm sorry."

"This is a new low, even for you guys," she said. At a red light she twisted around and asked what I then realized should have been the first question coming out of anybody. "Are you all okay?"



We all said yes with various degrees of excitement.

"Sneaking out of school past curfew and going to a college party are not terrible things." I choked as she said this. Then she continued, shaking her head. "But getting caught by the cops? Gee, not even I managed that during my years of rebellion."

Ayrton chimed in. "You make it sound as though your years of rebellion ended a while ago."

Jem laughed slightly, and I felt something uncoil a little inside me. Like I'd been as tense as though I'd been expecting a chancletazo out of nowhere.

"Good point. I guess the rule of thumb is to not do what Aunt Jem would do."

A false sense of security had fallen over us that drifted away as if carried by the night breeze as soon as we got out of the van by the school gates. The guard greeted us, along with two women that I could recognize in my sleep.

Mother Superior and Sister Louisa.

I swallowed with difficulty. It wasn't my past what flashed before my eyes, but my future. The future I wanted of finding myself away from my ma's rules and beliefs, which I could only get if I went to college and got a job somewhere else. I needed to stay in this school, that was for sure.

Ayrton chose that moment to say, "Well, it was nice to meet you all but from here on out you're on your own."

"Cut that out, Ayrton Winters," the Mother Superior said with surprising bite. "You may not be my student anymore by your own foolish choice, but you're not getting out of this."

Jem folded her arms. "Agreed."

The boy fumbled with his words. "Wait, what?"

"Follow me," Sister Louisa said. My feet moved automatically. I was hoping that if they saw I was obedient and remorseful and maybe offered to write a 10,000 word essay that they'd let me off the hook. All of us followed them into the school chapel and stood in a row by the first pew. The younger nun stood by the altar and turned to face us. "I can't begin to express how disappointed I am in all of you." I felt her eyes on me like a burn. I wasn't the only one who couldn't stand them, we all ended up looking at the floor. "Members of our school orchestra, baseball team and an ex-alum, sneaking out after curfew, jeopardizing their integrity and that of the school? This is such an affront to our school honor, we should expel you."

My heart froze in my throat. I looked up, tendrils of fear tightening their hold around me.

Mother Superior Evangeline joined her then. "Alas, we're an institution of education, not of punishment. What lesson will you learn if all the example we give you is of taking the easy way out?" She took her glasses off and rubbed at the crystals with the lapel of what I realized was her pajama shirt. She blew on them and put them back on, as if our futures were not dangling on the tip of her tongue.

"It'd be so much easier for us, for our school reputation, if we simply kicked you out and put out a statement that you are in no way associated with Holy Trinity High School, huh?"

I sensed a but. There had to be a but.

"But," the older woman continued, allowing me to breathe again. "That is not the kind of example we want to set. We are and will continue to be responsible for you. Even when you disappoint us, like tonight."

My eyes welled up again and I looked down.

"Do you know why you are in this school?" she asked us, and I felt her voice grow closer. I looked up and saw that she was pacing up and down our line, hands clasped at her back as she looked us up and down. "Have you ever wondered why you're in a boarding school in the middle of a city famous for its amusement parks, close to the beach and surrounded by nature?"



She paused in front of me and I shook my head slightly, not knowing where she was going with this.

Mother Superior's eyes softened a bit, or at least I imagined it.

"You're here, children, so that somebody can care for you."

I felt, more than saw or heard, the shock that passed through the entire line.

"Whatever the reason may be, your families are busy or broken or focused on other issues, but they've all placed their trust in us to take care of you, and that's what we'll do."

She said this to two kids whose dad was more focused on his political image than on his family. To two kids of color with few resources. To one whose parents seemed to be on the verge of divorce. Another one whose parents were a continent apart.

"And we'll do this as best as we can, better than your parents if possible." Mother Superior stood in front of the Winters boys. She patted both of their heads with difficulty, since they were a lot taller. The boys had to bend their knees to accommodate the gesture. "Definitely better than your father, who only seems to know how to brandish his money around."

Sister Louisa raised her chin. "Mr. Winters made a donation to the school in order to, quote, take care of the bad influences in his sons lives, unquote."

We all looked at each other, unable to believe what we were hearing.

My voice was a few octaves higher when I asked, "Me?"

"And probably me, too," Quinn said with a growl in his voice. "He's made sure I know my presence is never welcome."

Ashton said something under his breath that sounded suspiciously like a curse, but it got drowned in the commotion.

"Wow, and people think I'm bad," Madison said.

Addy shook her head, so stupefied she couldn't utter a word. Link spoke for all of us when he asked, "Is this for real? Isn't that blackmailing?"

Mother Superior beamed a smile so bright that it left us silent. "It would be, if we had accepted it and fulfilled that purpose."

"Wait," I said. "I don't get it."

The older woman stood in front of me, pleased as punch. "What we need is for you kids to develop your own moral compass and understand that just because someone is an adult doesn't mean they'll always be right. So, Vera, tell me. What do you think would be the responsible thing to do tonight, in light of all of these events?"

I flapped my mouth open and closed a few times.

She gave me a little hint. "Mr. Winters said, to take care of the bad influences. How can we turn them into good influences?"

From the corner of my eye I could see everybody looking at me. I swallowed and gave it a thought.

"Um, we could try to not sneak out of school after curfew?"

"That's a start." Mother Superior nodded. "What else?"

"Um, do our homework, follow the code of conduct, I don't know..."

"What about the money?"

I snapped my mouth shut because I'd just been about to say stuff it up his ass? And then I thought of something better. Something that man would probably hate. This may get me in hot waters with two nuns from the Catholic church, but I still said it.

"How about we donate the money to a charity for LGBTQ youth?"

A beat passed. Then there was a low whistle.

"Atta girl," Ayr said.

I could tell Sister Louisa was choking something back, but she held herself back as Mother Superior threw her head back and laughed.

"It sounds like just the perfect thing to do," she said. "As your punishment for tonight's shenanigans I want you all to find this charity and write a letter on behalf of our school. Show everybody that acceptance and love is what this world needs."

I was pretty sure that I looked like a cartoon with my jaw hanging a few inches off the floor. This had been entirely different from any outcome I'd have expected.

Sister Louisa smiled her Mona Lisa smile and ruined the moment for me. "It goes without saying that we'll be watching all of you with special interest from now on, especially with the recital we have coming up a couple of days before Thanksgiving where you'll be representing our school. And no weekend passes for a month. You're all dismissed, back to your dorms at once."

We all groaned as we began filing out of the chapel.

"And Ayrton?" Mother Superior asked, and we all stopped to hear what she was going to say. "It might be hard, since you're behind on the curriculum, but we still have room for you if you're ready to come back."

The boy stood there, blinking at her.

"I thought being gay was a capital sin in the eyes of the Church, or something," he said finally.

Mother Superior shocked us all by saying, "Some people believe so, but if you ask me? That is a load of bull."

♪ Sing, Sing ♪ Since we were pretty much on lockdown, it meant that we had a lot of time on our hands. A week went by after the incident and it felt like all of us were changed.

Ayrton came back to school. He told everybody who wanted to listen that it was because he didn't want to bother his aunt anymore. I rolled my eyes and let him say whatever floated his boat but I knew that he was brimming with excitement to be back. He was the one who helped us find a good charity to donate his dad's money to, though, and we all gleefully got together at the library after school one day to write letters of encouragement signed by the estate of Senator Albert Winters of Florida. We couldn't wait to see his reaction after the media picked up on it.

One Friday evening we were all lounging on the grass by the lake. The air already had a certain bite of fall chill, so I was in my sweatpants and a fluffy sweater I'd got a couple of years ago.

Addy poked at it. "I like this, where is it from?"

"Target," I said with a grin.

Dead serious she said, "They make the best stuff." Which I found funny, knowing that she was hardcore into fashion and wanted to pursue it as her long term career. She flipped open her sketchbook and passed a few sheets of paper around to the rest. "Check out some ideas I have. Maybe one of those would be a cool logo for the band."

Madison twirled her hair as she pointed at one. "I like this one. Makes me think of fangs."

Link's eyebrows went up. "I'd have thought that would be a bit, um, too goth of a look for you."

The girl's fingers froze as she stopped playing with her hair, the better to focus her might onto glaring at him. "Do I look like I'm into Barbies or some girly type shit?"

"Actually, yeah."

Apparently that had been the wrong answer, because it earned him a punch to the arm. That sent Quinn's head falling off her lap and he groaned a complaint that Madison drowned with kisses to his face.

"Why don't we record a music video?" Ayr asked. "We could put it up on Youtube and start racking up a following that way."

"Not a terrible idea, except for the part where we're stuck at school," Madison said.

"So what?" Ashton said then, resting his chin on his fist. "It's an awesome idea-"

Ayrton cut him off, "Thank you, clone."

His brother ignored the comment and continued. "We could use the music room as the setting. Link can produce the song with his equipment and we can just record the video with our iPhones."

Lincoln nodded, and was about to say something when I gasped, realizing something crucial.

"Wait, wait. Me? On camera?" My eyes went wide as saucers. "On Youtube?"



They all looked at me like I was crazy. It was Madison who dared to ask, "You have taken pictures of yourself, right? They're called selfies. Have you seen your own face that way before?" I rolled my eyes, annoyed that she sounded like Leti and about to spit some snark at her when she said, "Because it's not terrible. I don't know what you're afraid of."

have Addy lifted her hand as if asking for a pause. "Wow, did I just hear Madison Hollingsworth compliment somebody else?"

"Yeah, savor it. It's not gonna last."

I caught Ashton gazing at me as though he also didn't think my face was all that terrible.

"That's all well and good, but which song are we recording out of the handful we have?" Link asked.

"I was thinking that maybe we could write a new one altogether." We all looked at Ashton as he said this. He leaned back on his elbows. "A song about rebellion. Would that be exciting, Vera?"

I stiffened at being singled out. "Why do you ask me?"

"Well, you said that the vibe you want for our band is that, pretty much. Excitement." His eyes hypnotized me as he painted the picture. "You want the crowd to vibrate to the frequency of my guitar, Madison's bass, Quinn's drums, your voice."

Link protested. "What about me?"

Ashton waved a hand. "And whatever the hell it is you do."

"Hey!"

This brought a shudder out of me. I was sure that I was smiling the same way he was, as if we were hungry wolves in front of our prey.

"That's exactly what I want," I said. I had a brief glimpse of what this could be. Our music a shotgun. The ricochet from the crowd, the screaming of a mass of people reacting to our music. "How do we do this?"

"We tap into our experiences," he said. "Good and bad. We make a song that represents our generation. A song that pisses off our parents because we have the rest of our lives ahead of us, while they've let their hopes and dreams go. And we take this song to the battle of the new bands and kick ass."

That was the start of it.

We all wanted to get this one right. There was a lot of fighting as we tried to decide on the lyrics, over whether this word that rhymed actually said what we wanted to say. It was even worse when we had to put music to it. Every day after orchestra, we stayed behind in the music room to practice. And every day somebody would stomp out in anger. I wasn't immune to this. Even though I never would see myself as a diva, those days took a toll on me. I grew sick and tired of singing the same thing, over and over, hoping for different results.

One night in particular I tossed my microphone on the floor and left the room. I thought it'd be better to cool off outside than to strangle Ashton with the microphone's cord, although the fantasy was definitely in my mind. He in particular was pissing us all off.

Ashton followed me outside. He grabbed my hand and forced me to a stop.

"You're not giving up, are you?"

"No," I said as I whirled around. "But you need to understand that perfection doesn't exist. Not even in your mind. What you envision may not be what the rest of us want."

He ran his hand through his perfect, silky hair and I was pissed that I both wanted to stomp on his foot and kiss him.

"I know. I just really want us to take off, you know?"

"Then don't clip our wings," I said.

It got better the next days after that, until the weekend came and we were ready to record the music video. We'd asked the school for permission and they'd granted it. I was the only one who seemed shocked by this.



Addy laughed as she helped me get dressed in our room with the clothes she made. At a glance, I seemed to be wearing a regular t-shirt and jeans, but she'd added a few pins and spikes here and there for artistic touches. Leti Facetimed us as she explained how to do my makeup.

"I don't know what surprises you so much," my roommate said as she watched me botch up a winged eyeliner for the second time. "We pay a lot of dough to be in this school."

"These are the coolest nuns I've ever met," I admitted.

"You're right about that." Leti's voice came from Addy's iPad. "The ones from our church wouldn't even smile if you paid them. Why's your hand shaking so much? No wonder your makeup looks like a mess."

"Are you nervous?" Addy asked me.

I gave her and Leti a watery smile. "What gave me away?"

Addy took over after that. She finished my makeup and we made it downstairs. Once we reached the hallway with the music room, we noticed that there was a commotion. A bunch of students cluttered the entrance and we had to elbow our way in. All the chairs and stands were lined up outside, up and down the entire hall. Once we made it to the music room, I saw that it was empty except for the band's instruments in the middle.

Ayrton greeted us at the door. "Welcome to our studio for the day! Let me walk you through my creative vision." He hooked his arm with mine and walked me to the middle, where the rest of the guys were already with their instruments. "You're all going to stay pretty much in the middle, and I'll be circling around as I film you while you pretend I don't exist."

"Sounds rad," my roommate said. "I assume that means I have to stay outside."

"You and that little crowd out there," he said easily.

Addy saluted. "I'll keep them at bay."

I watched her go and close the door behind her. I turned back to face the guys and jumped out of my skin.

Madison had dyed her perfect, shiny, long blonde hair a pitch black.

I put my hands on my face. "What the hell did you do?"

"Meet the real me, bitches," she replied, with a wide smile with lips blacker than her eye liner.

I saw Link shaking his head on his side as he tried hard not to laugh. "And here I thought she was a Barbie."

Quinn still looked like the picture of a jock with his muscles and chiseled looks. Anyone would think he'd be horrified at what his girlfriend had done to her beautiful hair, but that apparently was just me, because he seemed unconcerned with the change.

"Are we ready?" he asked.

"One second," Ashton said. He stepped over the cable of his guitar and walked over to me. The corners of his lips lifted as he looked me up and down. "You're perfect."

Then he gave me a soft, too brief kiss on my lips and pulled away. When I opened my eyes he was handing me the microphone.

"Time to fly, V."

I took the microphone and got in position, facing Ayrton's camera. I lost track of everything except for the music and the words coming from my heart.

So pray It was only a few days later when Ayrton uploaded the video on Youtube that I started to get an idea of what had happened that afternoon. I'd gone into that room thinking I was just playing with some friends from school. Like kids who dressed up and played at being rockstars, instead of Disney characters or something.

But in a matter of days, we'd racked up hundreds of thousands of views.

We remained in lockdown for a month, just as the nuns promised. It was a fucking blessing. My ma did a lot of screaming over the phone, but it was easier to cope with it when I was surrounded by a group of people I felt I could really call my friends, as we did a lot of cool things together. We wrote more songs together as we watched the view count of our amateur music video escalate by the day. Link was quick to appropriate the credit for that after he posted the song on his Spotify account and directed all his social media followers to the Youtube link.





He rubbed his shoulder off for show one day. "What? You thought I was just the pretty, Asian token boy in the band? Bitch please. You're all gonna make it because I want it that way."

To which our collective response had been to sing Backstreet Boys' I Want It That Way because we knew it'd piss him off. Also because we knew he was probably right.

Another thing that also annoyed the whole hell out of him? When Madison flipped her now jet black hair and said, "Puh lease, it's because of how sexy I look in the video. Those views are all for me."

And she also had a good point. I was stricken by her the first time I saw the official cut of Ayr's video. She moved fluidly with the melody, her body swaying in a way that was almost artistic as she played her bass and flipped her hair around like a goth siren. Like she was an expert at working the camera and this was not her first rodeo.

Our favorite pastime between lessons and at the cafeteria was reading the comments that people were leaving. There were generic ones that said cool song as well as others that said u suck . But a few in between were more substantial and those were the ones we lived for.

cool song u suck "The dude in the guitar is super talented and hot," Ashton read with a shit eating grin that I wanted to smack off his face. I rolled my eyes and he latched on to that to ask, "Are you jealous, V?"

"Of your self esteem, yeah."

He scooted closer with his iPad. "You got some good comments, too. See? This one likes your hair."

I sighed. I guessed it was a compliment, but I was actually pretty annoyed that I wanted more.

I could see why my ma upended her entire life back in Venezuela to see if she had a shot at living off of this feeling of being seen and loved.

By the time we were finally allowed to have a weekend outside of the school, we'd arranged to go to a couple of underground places that Ashton had checked out online, but actually never been to, to see what the Orlando rock scene was like.

"For research purposes," he explained as we were on the way to the venue, crammed in his Jeep. "Most likely some of these bands will be part of the contest too."

When we walked into the place, there was a band playing on stage some kind of fast rock with high pitched guitars that was making my teeth rattle and my brain melt. I felt the sudden need to listen to some old school merengue or even Selena songs to cleanse back my palate. I heard Ash and Link talking about it, some heavy duty progressive metal type shit, they said, but the only two words I latched onto were the latter two.



"This is horrible!" I shouted at them and even they had to agree.

Unfortunately for us, the three other bands we saw that night were a lot better. I couldn't put my finger on why because I didn't have the jargon to describe it. In one band the drummer was an absolute beast, it seemed like he was hitting all the drums at once. In another one the combination of the singer and the lead guitar was what carried the entire show. They had so much chemistry that I felt jealous one second and flustered the next, when Ash leaned down to me and promised that we could replicate that. I spent most of the night glued to his side, his arm around me and I was surprised with how comfortable it was.

At one point I excused myself to the restroom and Madison and Ayrton decided to tag along. There were a couple of girls in the women's bathroom grading the looks of the different guys they'd seen on stage and it struck me that, not only hadn't I even noticed that, but I also realized I hadn't seen a single girl on stage that night.

"Just you wait," Madison told me as we washed our hands and I mentioned this. "Once we walk onto that stage at the battle of the new bands, we'll be a sensation for being a band with two girls who can kick ass."

"I know you do, but me?" I asked, scoffing.

She rolled her eyes as she drew her hands with her jeans, since there were no paper towels available. The picture of seeing a super rich girl doing this with ease made me smile.

"Fine, if you're fishing for compliments I'll give you one." She paused and flicked my forehead. "You need to give better credit to yourself because you do kick some fucking ass."

I stared at her back as she left the bathroom. Then I looked at my reflection in the mirror. Chub brown girl with a mass of curls and an uncertain dimply smile. I wiped it off and painted on a fresher, more confident look on my face. I'd never really thought of myself as a person who needed external validation, but at that second I understood that I was. It was always me who was beating myself down. I was too short. I was too fat. My hair was too curly. My muffin top was too visible. And yet I had people in my life who told me I was good at something, valuable to them, in their own little ways and I was reluctant to believe them.

I tilted my head at myself and asked aloud, "Well, what happens if I start to believe them?"

It was as if the answer came when I stepped outside of the bathroom and found Ayrton outside.

"I was waiting for you."

My eyebrows went up. "You were?"

"Yeah, I was hoping we could maybe catch a word away from the others."

We moved to a corner by the bar, where we could see the other guys standing in the crowd but were definitely not going to be overheard.

He surprised me by saying, "You know if I were straight I'd be wrestling my brother for you."

" What? "

What? Ayrton laughed, easy and deep. "I mean, you're pretty extraordinary, you know? Smart, talented and real pretty. Even I can see what he sees in you."

I gave him a wan smile. "Looks like both brothers are blind."

"No, I'm serious." And then his expression did in fact turn serious. "If it weren't for you Ash maybe would never have gathered the nerve to go find me in Sarasota. If it weren't for you standing up to our father in jail — which was fucking metal by the way-"

"Thanks?" I asked.

"You're welcome — if it weren't for that and what you told Mother Superior that night, I'd probably still be in hiding, moping about how nobody accepts me."



My jaw hung for a moment. I looked at this boy who was gorgeous and sweet and friendly and couldn't imagine what he'd gone through. I'd grown up looking at people of wealth as though they had no care in the world, as though they didn't even have a fleck of a problem, but some issues didn't give a damn about wealth or poverty. I didn't know what to tell him. I hadn't set out to be a crusader. I struggled every day with just trying to understand my own place in the world.

"That wasn't on me, Ayr. That was all on your brother." Because credit where it was due, I thought. "Sure, he was slow on the uptake, but he was the one who decided to make the trip to see you and I just tagged along. And after the party, I recall he was the one standing next to you as you faced off with your dad."

"And you were his moral support all along." He rocked on the balls of his feet and added, "And you also got him talking to his old pals again."

"Now you're reaching." My eyes rolled. "That was all on them, I don't even know how they decided to make peace again."

"How?" Ayrton asked me, blinking owlishly at me. "He accepted them in his band just that he could have you in it, too. Don't you remember?"

I pursed my lips. "He told you about that?"

"Oh yeah, he was real pleased he convinced you just as he was mad that he'd have to deal with his ex BFFs."

"Okay, here's the thing." I folded my arms. "You're making it all sound like I'm some great Mother Theresa when I was just standing around throughout all of this, scared out of my mind for one reason or another."

I looked at the others and made eye contact with Quinn. He tilted his head toward me with a cute little smile that made me feel like he was proving Ayrton's point somehow. I wasn't some sort of glue that brought all these people together. They'd just needed a push and things just kind of happened. I was sure it'd have worked out fine if our paths had never crossed.

"That might be so but you're the one who made all of this happen," he said and contradicted everything I thought. I snapped my focus back to him. "We were all here before, making the same stupid mistake of not being honest to each other. As soon as you came in, you shook everything up." He put his hand on my shoulder and looked deep into my eyes. "You need to give yourself more credit, because from where I'm standing you're pretty damn great and I'm thankful you're in our lives."

It took me a surprising amount of time to compose myself after that. I hung out with the guys as we watched the show and drank sodas, but my chest was constricted with the need to cry.

I wasn't used to feeling... appreciated.

I thought about this a lot as the twins drove me home that night. That I'd sought this from my weird family my entire life and instead got it from this weird rag tag group of people who, at a glance, I had nothing in common with.

As Ashton pulled the Jeep to a stop by the curb of the gringo's house, he turned to face me and asked, "So, what'd you think about tonight?"

"Eye opening," I said. In more ways than one.

"I only have one complaint," Ayr said from the backseat. He leaned forward and stuck his head in between Ash and I. "There was nowhere near enough kissing."

Ashton groaned and I gave out this weird nervous laugh I'd never heard come out of myself. Then there was a knock on my window and once I turned reflexively to see who it was, my stomach plummeted.

It was the gringo.

"Who is that?" Ash asked, his voice on edge.

I swallowed. "My step father."



Said man motioned for me to roll down my window. I honestly didn't want to, but I had little choice.

As soon as I did the stench of alcohol wafted into my nostrils. He leaned on the car and looked at the passengers.

"Two boys bringing you home together?" He whistled, and the way he'd said it made bile rise in my throat. "I didn't know you had it in you. Is this what you've been up to in that fancy school of yours?"

I heard a sharp intake of breath next to me.

"Where's ma?" I asked through gritted teeth, reaching out in the dark to grab Ashton's hand.

"Waiting for you inside, or would you like to stay with your little rich buddies here?"

"Maybe she should," Ashton said with a clipped tone that reminded me of his dad.

"Yeah, maybe she should," the gringo said with a nasty smile.

Ma came out of the house at that moment looking like a fury. And here I'd thought it couldn't get any worse.

"Vera Maria, what have I told you about hanging out with these boys?" She swept a nasty look at Ashton, since he was the only one she could see from a couple of paces behind her husband. "They're the sons of a client and not people you're ever going to see after you're through with high school. You should pay more attention to your studies than to your hormones, if that's what this is about."

My face burned and my heart hammered with shame and anger.

I tried to please her for so long that I never raised my voice back at her. I never contradicted her. I tried to be obedient and good and this was unfair.

"With all due respect, ma'am," Ash said at the same time as he laced his fingers with mine and squeezed my hand. "You're absolutely wrong. We are going to keep seeing each other well after high school."

are Ayrton said a, "yep."

The gringo threw his head back and laughed and swayed. "Your girl had a way better strategy than you, Victoria. Unlike you at least it looks like she nabbed someone with money."

As I saw my ma's face tighten and turn ashen I realized that the whole reason why this conversation was happening had been because they'd been in a fight and were using me to nip at each other. In front of my friends.

I took a deep breath, let Ashton's hand go and unfastened my seatbelt. I jumped out of the car and slammed the door shut.

"Thanks for bringing me home, you guys. I'll call you tomorrow, okay?"

Ash's face turned to stone, and his brother asked, "Are you sure?"

I nodded and before I could change my mind swiveled around and headed into the house. I found my baby brother peeping from the hallway. He dashed into his room and I followed him inside too.

"They were screaming," he said, his eyes wide. It wasn't terribly uncommon but that didn't mean we were unfazed when it happened. I felt my phone buzz in my pockets but I ignored it as I picked Victor up and sat him on my lap.

The front door was slammed closed and there was a tense calm for a quick moment. Then the bedroom door was swung open and ma stood there, ready to offload all her anger on me. She'd always said she married him for love but I'd never been convinced that somebody could feel that for a drunk ass who was content on cruising through life with little work, while his immigrant wife slaved away cleaning other people's homes seven days a week. She'd got papers through marrying him but also got him as a reward.

him "I didn't send you to that school so that you could be chasing around rich boys and embarrassing me in the process!"

I snapped.

"Embarrassing you?" I asked. "How?"

She pointed a finger at me like an accusation. "Not focusing in school and wasting every moment you can having fun with them."

I rolled my eyes. I was done with tip toeing around her moods and wants. I was done putting myself second.

"You say it like having fun is a bad thing."

"Having fun is what got me pregnant with you!" Even though I froze, she didn't stop there. "Having fun chasing a stupid dream is what got me pregnant and so broke that I couldn't even afford a ticket to fly back home. I had to stay in this country and raise you all by myself, to see you act like a spoiled malagradecida! "

malagradecida! My brother ran away crying and I was glad, because then he wouldn't hear what I was going to say next.

I stood up and even though my heart was breaking into a tiny million pieces, I spoke in the calmest voice I'd ever mustered as I said, "You know what, mamá, I'm sorry your life didn't turn out the way you wanted it. But that is not my fault , and I'm sick and tired of you taking that out on me every time you feel bad about yourself." I lifted my chin. "And I reject your notion that no matter how hard I try to be good, a good daughter, a good student, a good freaking person, you seem to think I'll turn out just like you. Because I won't."

that is not my fault I left her standing there, stunned. I walked out of the front door, ignoring the gringo's screams asking where I was going. I was going to crash at Leti's for the night, but as soon as I came outside I was floored to see the white Jeep still parked by the curb, and the twins waiting outside. I took a step forward and then picked up the pace and ran into Ashton's arms, already unable to stop the tears from falling.

"Take me away," I told him as I hugged him tight. I felt him move before he wrapped his arms around me and kissed the top of my hair.

"Anytime," he murmured.

So they whisked me away and although I came back to the house in the barrio the next day, ma and I were never the same we were before that night. And I couldn't be any more fucking glad for it.

♪ I Write Tragedies, Not Romances ♪

In full disclosure, I had my doubts. Like, on the one hand I left the gringo's house that night feeling vindicated but on the other hand I had the niggling question circling my mind of what this would mean to me.





I sought music as a refuge from the following week onward. And music that I was getting interested in now, rather than what my ma had taught me to like. I realized I'd stopped listening to Selena and Olga and Celia and had replaced it for heavy doses of guitars. One night I brought this up as Leti and I were texting.

I thought so at first , she texted me, confirming my worst fears. I saw the three dots working at the bottom of the screen as she crafted another text. The dots disappeared for a second and I sat up in my bed. It was late enough that Addy was already asleep, dead tired after she spent the whole afternoon designing clothes and listening to Lady Gaga on full blast.

I thought so at first Then the text came in.

Look, I was pretty shitty about you moving to your new school at first because, yeah, I felt betrayed. And then you started talking about your white boy and I thought you were going crazy thinking you wanted to be like them. But then I saw you singing that weird shit they call music and actually? My thoughts? You are better than them because you're built with 100% raíces hispanas. You're more hungry for success than they are, and you won't stop working until you get it.

Look, I was pretty shitty about you moving to your new school at first because, yeah, I felt betrayed. And then you started talking about your white boy and I thought you were going crazy thinking you wanted to be like them. But then I saw you singing that weird shit they call music and actually? My thoughts? You are better than them because you're built with 100% raíces hispanas. You're more hungry for success than they are, and you won't stop working until you get it. My eyes ran through her words several times, as if to check that I wasn't hallucinating. My heart was shattered and I was hurting that my own mother couldn't support me the way my friends did. Even when we fought or didn't talk for a while, like it happened with Leti and I sometimes, I was always going to be thankful to have them.

Gracias, perra , was all I could text her back because I was already sobbing and I had to try to not wake Addy up. I unlocked the screen as I got another text from her.

Gracias, perra De nada. Don't make me say cursi shit like that ever again .

De nada. Don't make me say cursi shit like that ever again I thought about that exchange a lot in the upcoming weeks of both orchestra and band practice. I seemed to finally be finding my place in the world. This world. I jumped into orchestra practice right after class every day, where I worked to hone my technique and understanding of music basics. I was not getting ugly glares from some of my club mates, and even the two girls who pranked me were acting exceptionally nice to me. But that might have something to do with the fact that our band's Youtube video was pretty much going viral and they were basking in how cool it was to be close to famous people — their words, not mine. I just let them be and enjoyed the flash of fear in their eyes every time they looked at me.

Then after orchestra was band time. I didn't focus on technique there, but on heart. On trying to deliver a performance that would shake my floor if I were in the crowd. Of course, I didn't always manage. I still had a problem of being jarred out of focus when something changed in the melody that I wasn't expecting.



Link shook his head once and said, "The weird problems of someone with perfect hearing."

Quinn was having an easier time of things now that the baseball team had been kicked out of the big tournament. They still assembled for morning practice and had the occasional friendly, but most of his spare time he spent with us, hitting the drums so hard that he'd developed larger arm muscles. A feat that Madison made sure to brag about, which was both gross and funny to me.

I also got to experience the curious effect of the parting masses as Ash and I walked down the halls hand in hand. I knew there were a few bad whispers but he was pretty good at wrapping me up in a cocoon of purpose for the band and a cocktail of fluttery feelings in my belly. The latter were in majority because of him but as Thanksgiving drew closer, they started to become more and more about the contest.

It was a week before the day, when Ash and I walked into the music room together, talking about one of our new attempts of a song, when life gave us a proverbial slap on the face.

"Welcome everybody," Sister Louisa was with Mr. Burlington as she greeted us. We all took our usual places in the orchestra and after the noise settled down she continued. "As you all know, we have our Thanksgiving showcase next week, which officially kicks off our season of events. We'll be very busy this winter."

It wasn't like I'd forgotten about it, but I did put it to the back of my mind.

Mr. Burlington dropped the MOAB then. "Remember, we'll be dismissing class a tad early on the 22nd so that we can drive to the venue. I expect all of you prepared to depart at 4.30pm sharp. We will get there at close to a quarter past, and the recital will begin at 6pm."

I sucked in a breath so sharp that I must have stolen half of the oxygen in the room, and even though that caught some attention, Ashton raised his hand like a whip and asked, "But I thought the recital was on the 21st, what happened?"

The older man looked confused. "Oh, I'm sorry but where did you get that information?"

Ashton's frown deepened as he turned to Sister Louisa and said, "Don't you remember? When we were all, er — praying in the chapel. You said the recital would be a couple of days before Thanksgiving."

She tilted her head as she regarded him in silence.

"Did I?" Sister Louisa asked. "I must have made a mistake. Why do you ask?"

And God help me for sinning but at that very second I hated her. All along I'd thought she was a stern person, more so even than the school's own headmistress, but the sweet innocent tone of her voice made me feel like there was no mistake.

I saw Ashton swallow hard and I could imagine that what he was swallowing were some specific colorful words. In my mind I was freely calling her all sorts of blasphemies I didn't feel a little bit sorry about.

"Our band has a contest that night," he bit out.

My whole body and soul froze at what she said next.

"Well, I guess you're just going to have to skip it, won't you?"

"We're not gonna skip shit," Madison screamed a couple of hours later when we had the room all to ourselves again. I would've liked it if she'd blurted that out in front of Sister Louisa's face to see how that went.

And even more, I'd have loved to be able to back her up.

But I couldn't.

"I can't," I said. Four pairs of eyes swung to me. It was one in particular I had trouble meeting head on.

"What do you mean you can't?" he asked. My Ashton.

I looked down at my hands as they wrung each other. "I mean, I have to sing at the recital and I can't be in two places at one."



"That's because you don't have to." As he said this, he sounded more confused than anything else. "You can only be in one."

As the silence stretched I gathered the nerve to look up at him and saw the understanding dawn on him in the way his face turned to ice.

I cringed and was already to feel a certain prick in my eyes.

"I'm on a scholarship," I reminded him and the other guys. "My entire future is riding on this."

He shook his head in jerky motions. "I get it, but what if your future is not the orchestra but this band?"

But at that second I was exposing the ugly truth that I didn't see eye to eye with him on that.

Quinn stood up from his chair and stood in front of me. I didn't find any anger or disappointment in his face. Instead he put one hand on my shoulder. "I understand. If I'd had to choose between the baseball team and the band, well, the band is just for fun."

"It's not just for fun. This is life or death for me." Ashton ran a hand through his hair and pulled at it slightly. "I'm not going to go through my life following my dad's orders and plans. I'm not going to law school or becoming a politician. I'm a musician. That's what I want my life to be."

"Yeah, and that's fine, Ash," Quinn said. "But you have to understand that other people might not have the same goal as you."

That seemed to strike him to his core. I'd said something similar to him once, but this one stabbed him in the heart.

Madison grabbed her dark hair and pushed it behind her shoulder before leaning back on her chair and leveling a strange look on her boyfriend. "I'm with Ash on this one. You can only do great things by making great sacrifices."

"Oh yeah?" her boyfriend asked her. "And what are you sacrificing? Because may I remind you all, you're in this school, playing with expensive instruments and dreaming of a bohemian life when it's all paid by your parents."

Her colors rose to her cheeks and she bit her lip in a way that looked painful. "How's that our fault? And do you even see all that money buying us happiness? Ash and Ayr and I have shitty parents who are much happier living their lives away from us, but now it's wrong for us to want to do our own thing?"

"But that's the thing," I said softly. I didn't care that there were hot tears streaming down my face in front of all of them. "Despite all of that, you can. You have the means to be free. Quinn and I, people like us have to follow the rules of the game to a T and hope we can make it. For me, that's making sure I can keep my scholarship. So I have to put the recital first."

Link scraped his chair against the floor as he stood up. I looked at him for the first time and he was furious, his face contorted into a mask I'd never seen before. And as he begun talking I was sure he was going to curse Quinn and I to hell and back, especially me.

"I'm a musician too and that's what I'm betting my future livelihood on, but the reason I'm here with you all, in this school, is because my dad works 24/7 in Korea so that I can live out my dreams." He picked up his case and marched over to the door. Before leaving he turned around and said, "And I'll be damned if I get in the way of other people's struggle. So I guess this fucking band is over because I'll support Vera on this, and shame on you all if you don't."

Right then doing the right thing and its consequences finished breaking the last part of my heart that had remained whole.

♪ It's Alive ♪ I'd always thought that there was a proverbial carrot being dangled in front of me, always in sight but never within reach. I'd never stopped to think that there might be two carrots, or more, each one taking me down a completely different path. Somehow I'd put myself in the position where I was always chasing that elusive thing. Self satisfaction. Happiness. Acceptance. The concept that I could maybe get this through different means had never passed through my head.

Even though that night I made a decision to ensure I didn't lose my scholarship, I hesitated. I knew I was a total noob when it came to music, and that I was maybe wrapped into the newness of it that I placed a lot more value on what we were making than it surely deserved. There were people out there who had this dream since they were kids. Who practiced every day, every night. Who wrote more songs. Played in more events. Had more fans. Were better. And yet... and yet.

The Youtube views count continued to go up. It didn't mean anything. It wasn't like our video had surpassed Despacito. It wasn't also like I'd let the numbers get to my head and inflate it with a false sense of grandness. It was just mind blowing to see that something I participated of had an impact on other people.

Did I really want to chase the other carrot? The one that would lead me down the path of a quiet life at college and a quiet life thereafter?

"I understand your fears," Addy told me the night before the recital and the contest, as we sat on our beds and chatted. "You have a lot at stake right now, but have you wondered what is it that you really want?"

I thought about it, and the answer shocked me even though it had been there all along.

I didn't want to go to college because it was one of my goals in life. I just-

"I want to get away," I said.

"From where?" she asked. "Or from what?"

I squirmed, picked up the hem of my pajama top and fumbled with it. "It's going to sound really bad."

"Try me."

With a deep breath I said, "From my ma."

But she just nodded. "I feel you. My parents and their divorce are driving me crazy and all I can think of is getting into college and then a job in fashion, preferably in Italy, where I won't be able to hear their drama for a while."

I smiled a little. "I'm sorry, it must suck for you."

Addy shrugged as she braided her hair. "It's not that bad, they're just two big babies."

"Okay, but, how do I do that?" I asked her, worrying my bottom lip.

"Be a big baby? Easy, blame everybody else for your own mistakes."

"Um, I mean, the going away from my ma part, without being a complete and ungrateful child?" I sighed and rubbed my temple. "I've always thought college is the way and now there's the band... but it's stupid to think that this band will go anywhere. I mean, as soon as we graduate everybody will go their way. And even if that weren't the case, so many people are trying to break into the music industry that I don't even think Winters money can get Ash where he wants to be."



"I don't think that's what he wants. His dad doesn't seem like the pampering type of guy either."

I cringed at the memory of the senator saying things that though subtle made my blood boil. "Yeah, you're right."

"Besides," she added, pointing at me with her finger. "Sure, not everybody makes it, but what makes you think that you guys don't have what it takes?"

My mouth opened, but I didn't know what to say. I'd just never had anything easy in my life. I didn't just decide, bam, I'm going on a diet and the pounds magicked themselves away. I had to work hard and in the end, not get results. It was a recurring thing for me.

"Because from my vantage," she continued. "You guys have what it takes. There are heaps of talent just on your hair alone." That made me laugh. "And when you put the rest of them together with you, there's so much spark it actually causes a fire."

My eyes bulged. "For real?"

"For really real. I don't think I have to be some music critic snob to see that." As a last stroke she added, "And if you guys go to the contest tomorrow, I think even the music critic snobs will see that."

I couldn't sleep that night, tossing and turning and fretting over what I should do. My head and my heart weren't talking, but that was because the latter was silent.

I sat on my desk the next day, staring absentmindedly in front of me for the entire day of school. The hours stretched to what felt like years. Several thoughts danced in my head all that time, showing me potential futures, all the carrots, and my sane mind said that the best thing I could do was just join the recital and stick to my plan. It was the surest path.

Mr. Burlington dismissed our class early, as he'd planned. All the orchestra kids met at the lobby as we waited for the school bus to be loaded with everybody's instruments and equipment. Somehow I was surprised to see that Ashton and Madison had joined too. For some reason I thought they'd at least go watch the contest. I looked down at the floor. Ash had traded seats with Link again, and I hadn't felt his eyes on me the whole day. I definitely felt them now.

"How you feeling?" Link asked me.

I looked up at him with a grimace. "Truth talk? Like shit."

"Yeah, same. Try to imagine what it is like to be Ashton's roommate when he's acting like a petulant brat."

"It's his dream," I said. "This matters to him."

"It's mine too, but you don't see me acting like a big baby about it."

That made me smile a little, reminding me of Addy's same comment. We all filed into the bus and I sat together with Link, just behind the two mean girls and several rows in front of where Ash and Madison sat together for the first time in months.

"Do you think they're back together?" one of the mean girls asked the other one, looking back in the least discrete way.

"Oh my God, that'd be like, so crazy."

"Shut up," I told them, enjoying how they startled at realizing who the command came from, and even more when they obeyed.

Lincoln sighed. He pulled out his headphones and put them on. I looked out the window for the entire ride, trying to calm my breathing and my heartbeat. It seemed to get louder the closer we got to the venue of the recital.

I was sweating buckets by the time we got there and for a moment I wondered if I was getting sick. I had to sit down for a bit as everybody started setting up on the stage. Even Sister Louisa looked over with some worry. I had to force myself to cast my glare away from her.



It landed on Ashton. He was sitting on his chair with his viola on his lap, looking directly at me. There was nothing in his face. No anger, no disappointment or resentment. No feeling at all. And that gutted me more than any of the alternatives. I wonder what I'd do if we stopped talking, and thinking of my life before him extending in my future made me sad to the bone. Who else was going to encourage me to get out of my comfort zone? Who else could so readily accept me for who I was?

I was sure someone else might, one day. But I didn't want to picture anybody but him.

Was he my other carrot? Could I bet on a crazy boy with a dream? A boy who often fucked things up when he was trying to do good. Who was sweet and bold and shy sometimes, when he was caught unaware and dropped the persona of the son of a senator, responsible for parting the masses as he walked through life.

I clenched my jaw so tight that it hurt. Sister Louisa was already in place to begin the first song. The audience, students like us, sponsors and public, were silent and ready for Holy Trinity High School to open the show.

I'd had enough time to think about it and I got to this realization: just because something seemed like the right thing to do didn't mean it was.

And then with my heart throbbing in my throat, with every eye in the auditorium on me, I stepped forward, took a deep breath and told Sister Louisa the words that would seal my fate.

"I can't do this."

She did a double take. Her baton dropped slightly.

"Excuse me?"

"I said," and I enunciated every word slowly, clearly, so it would carry where it had to. "I can't do this. I have somewhere else I have to be."

She spluttered. "Where else could you possibly be?"

I smiled, because I knew she knew exactly where I was going with this. The reason Mr. Burlington dismissed class early was so that kids could travel to meet their families for the holidays. We were not on curfew anymore, and yes, this was an official school event, but I'd read the school code of conduct and it explicitly stated that it respected students' privacy during off school hours. If I'd said that I had an important family event and couldn't attend this recital, they couldn't have forced me.

She knew our band had other plans. We hadn't been exactly discreet about it. The entire school had been talking about us and the battle of the new bands competition. She'd craftily neglected to mention the recital was the same day until it was too late, until we were trapped.

Well, fuck it. There were other things in life than following the predetermined path. I was ready to rebel.

"I have a contest to win," I said.

I twirled around in time to see Ash, Madison and Link stand up at the same time. The first two just left their instruments on their chairs to join me, and Link carefully covered the piano keys.

"So do I," Ashton told her.

Madison grabbed both of our arms and pushed us off the stage. Link followed, laughing as Sister Louise screeched our names and the various ways she was going to punish us.

"Ay Dios mío," I kept repeating to myself as we traced our steps back to the entrance.

"That was so cool ," Madison told me, nudging my shoulder. "I didn't know you had the cojones to do something like that."

cool I appreciated her effort at Spanish, but she pronounced it as cajones , which was an entirely different word. It was so ridiculous that I even threw my head back and laughed.

cajones Link cut me off. "Okay, I agree that was major kickass but what now?"

Ashton had the biggest shit eating grin when he said, "Actually, I was hoping this would happen."

He motioned us to go outside where we saw a familiar van parked by the entrance of the building. The window rolled down and we saw Ayrton on the wheel and Quinn next to him.

I startled. "What the-"

Quinn waved. "Well, it's not like I had a baseball game at the same time or something."

Ayrton pushed him back and said, "Get in the van, bitches! We're going to rock and roll this town."

We all hooted and hollered as we climbed onto the van, falling in a haphazard knot of limbs. After we were buckled up and Ayrton peeled off and away, I had no doubts anymore.

My path was to rebel. To be myself. To be different.

I reached out and grabbed Ashton's hand. His eyes turned to me, wide as saucers, and they softened when he saw my expression.

I was smiling from ear to ear, because at least I wouldn't do this thing alone.

♪ Livin' On A Dream ♪ We weren't allowed to go home for Thanksgiving. Instead, our parents were summoned to the school to meet with the Mother Superior and Sister Louisa.

They made us sit outside of the headmistress's office as we waited for our parents to arrive. Lincoln, Madison, Ashton and I. Quinn and Ayrton were off the hook because them going to the contest hadn't interfered with any school activity. Still, they were in the hallway with us, waiting to see what the verdict would be for us four.

I took a deep breath, thinking of how important getting into this school had been for me last summer. How I knew, somehow, that it would change my life. Ashton grabbed my hand and laced our fingers together. We looked at each other and for the first time I realized that even though I didn't know what was going to happen to me, if the consequences of my actions would lash out negatively, I was okay with whatever outcome. I wouldn't change a thing.

Yesterday had changed my life. This was a fact I'd remember even in the crazy years to come.

We'd made it to the contest in our full private school uniforms, which was a surefire way to not have been taken seriously. But my roommate had our backs. Just before she left to join her parents for a last Thanksgiving together, she gave Ayr a bag full of t-shirts she'd apparently been working on in secret. Each one was different but all with the same logo she'd designed for Casual Friday Funeral, black and white and as Madison had put it, fangy. We changed in the van and looked at each other with amusement.

Madison had tied a knot at the front of her t-shirt, baring her midriff and toeing the line of school girl fetishism. When I pointed it out she said, "That's my plan all along. I'm counting on some sleazy men being part of the jury."

Addy knew I was not for flashy and I just tucked my short sleeved t-shirt into my skirt. I was sure I looked like a little girl in comparison, but that didn't matter. I just had to impress them with my pipes.

Ash and Quinn were showing quite a bit of skin in matching wife beaters with side openings that plunged all the way to the bottom. In my mind I thanked my roommate for the eye candy but I tried not to be too obvious as I stared at them.

"Aw man," Link said then, looking at his simple t-shirt with no frills after he'd gotten out of the car. "Does Addy think I have no guns to show or what?"

Ayrton laughed as he jumped from the driver's seat and locked the van. He motioned down at himself wearing a matching wife beater. "Sorry, bruh. I claimed dibs."

We joined the line of contestants in time before they closed applications and were given the number 63. My nerves ran amok as I watched the other bands give it their all on stage. Some were abysmal but most of them sounded like they had experience. Even I could tell.

The feeling of anxiety propagated among my group of friends until we were all bouncing and jittery with every passing second. It was probably two hours until we had to perform and at some point I stopped realizing where I was and what I was doing.



I only seemed to wake up when I found myself standing in front of the glare of a spotlight. It was so bright that I couldn't see anybody in front of me. Not the judges. Not anybody in the crowd. It was as though the place was full of nothingness, except for that beacon, and thinking that it was just me and my friends calmed me down. I grabbed the microphone.

"Hello everybody," I said. "We are Casual Friday Funeral and we're here to rock your brains off."

I ignored the sounds I heard after that, a strange combination of boos and the indifference of wane applause. I turned back and Link gave me a thumbs up. Madison nodded at me with her little smirk that I'd found intimidating when I first met her. Quinn saluted me with his sticks. Ashton just smiled that placid little smile that reached his eyes and turned them into the Caribbean ocean in a quiet summer morning. I felt myself returning the gesture before I faced the microphone again.

I took a deep breath and we blew up on the stage together.

Figuratively, of course, I thought with a smile as my mind drifted back to the hallway as we waited to find out our fates.

That had been the most intense, incredible moment of my life. How could I possibly regret it?

"I don't want to jinx things," Quinn said with a quiet voice, shifting his eyes to the heavy doors towards the headmistress's office. "But what are we going to do if, you know, they expel you?"

"We won't drop the band, if that's what you're wondering," Ashton said.

The other boy nodded.

After a while the door opened and the headmistress announced that they'd finally been able to connect with Lincoln's parents via Skype. She motioned him inside and closed the door off to keep the conversation private. Still, we heard a lot of screaming occasionally arise from tinny voices. We all looked at each other with wide eyes and jumped out of our skins as Link came out, clenching his jaw so tight it was a wonder his teeth didn't break to pieces.

"How'd it go?" I asked him, but he was unable to answer as the senator and his wife arrived then.

I'd never met Ashton and Ayrton's mom before. She was beautiful in that way you could tell that she was a woman who'd grown up with the best care, the best clothes, and the best perfumes, even if the latter was laced with something tangy that seemed like alcohol to me.

Ayrton tried to join them, but his father put a hand up and said, "This doesn't concern you. Stay outside."

I couldn't begin to describe how much my heart broke for the two boys who'd grown up with parents who didn't seem capable of doling out the love they deserved. Ayr's eyes flashed but I distracted him, motioning for him to join me. He did and I held his hand in mine.

After the doors were closed I said, "I'm sorry your parents suck."

He laughed a little. "That's the sweetest thing somebody's ever said to me before."

This interview took the longest and it was really the one that worried me the most, so at some point it was not me providing some comfort to Ayrton, but him giving it to me. We stood up as the doors opened and ran to Ashton's side. He was glaring at the back of his parents and we saw his mom stumble for a second. The senator finally offered her his arm for balance and as they left I wondered if that little gesture was maybe as far as the man was capable of showing affection. It was not enough.

"Please come in, Miss Hollingsworth," the headmistress said. "We'll have to connect with your parents remotely as well, since they're abroad."

Madison flipped her hair back and stood up with elegance that was only marred by the roll of her eyes. My ma appeared around the corner then. I saw her eye the twins with something more than dislike but she refrained herself from making a scene right there and then.



"Hola, ma," I said. She just nodded at me.

Ayrton turned to his brother, "So, how'd it go?"

Ash sighed and looked at all of us. "Let's just all get together once this is done and talk it out."

The door opened again and out came Madison with her poker face of a smirk. We all gaped at her.

"Dude, you were there for like thirty seconds, I swear," Ayr said.

"Vera?" the headmistress called. Then her eyes shifted to my ma. "Ah, Mrs. de la Cruz, please come on in."

"Mrs. Johnson soon," my ma said as she bypassed me and stepped into the office. "I'm finally taking my husband's last name."

I looked down so that my hair would hide my huge roll of eyes.

The Mother Superior motioned for us to sit in two chairs by her desk. Sister Louisa was standing across from us, behind the desk. She busied herself pushing the chair in as the headmistress sat, but her eyes blazed with even more anger than I'd seen yesterday when we left her standing in front of an incomplete orchestra.

I probably should've been worried, but even then I didn't feel like I'd done something wrong. Until my ma hissed under her breath.

"Qué te dije, Vera Maria? Que no te juntaras con esos niños, que solo te iban a meter en problemas. Y míranos ahora."

The Mother Superior put on her glasses and didn't even bother asking for a translation.

"Ma'am, you're already aware of the reason for your visit. Your daughter here left a school function to go join a music contest with her friends."

My ma's lips pursed for a second so tight that they turned white. "Yes, and I apologize. This doesn't reflect the values I teach her at home. She knows better than to disobey her elders."

I had a feeling she and Sister Louisa would've got along very well if it weren't for me.

Mother Superior Evangeline waved a hand, dismissing my ma's entire argument. She leveled her stare on me. "Vera, what are your thoughts?"

"None that I care to share, so to preserve the integrity of my face," I said, honestly.

The older woman's mouth twitched as the other two gasped. "And how'd you do in the contest?"

I sat up straighter. "We placed second."

I wasn't even disappointed that first place had been in reach, though it eluded us. I wasn't even jealous that another band had been considered superior, or that it won the top prizes we all coveted. I wasn't even consumed by the need to understand what we'd been missing.

I was so overcome by amazement that we'd even been recognized at all. That a monster of Frankenstein band like us, formed in just a short few months, with next to no experience under our belt, had managed to impress a jury with industry insiders.

"And made our school very proud," the headmistress shocked all of us by saying. She laughed. "Why do you all look so surprised? I've made no secret of the fact that I admitted Vera into this school to help her develop her beautiful gift. If that's in the orchestra or in a rock band, I don't really care."

My jaw dropped.

Sister Louisa bit her tongue and I put two and two together. That was why she'd been so angry all along. Because with each interview, this had been the headmistress's stance.

"To be honest, I know that the responsible thing to do would be to punish the kids. But the fact of the matter is that it's the school who went against our own guidelines." She pushed a booklet towards my ma and pointed at is as she said, "You see, while the kids are on the official school clock, they have to follow this. But the moment class is dismissed or during a holiday, it's personal time."

I felt like my head was exploding. "I thought so," I murmured.

"It's a shame for the recital," the older woman continued. "But there will be others, and I'm sure you can balance the orchestra with your band, just as you've been doing all along. Right, Vera?"

I sat up straight, not even caring to hide my smile. "Absolutely, ma'am."

She nodded and then faced my ma again, who'd been ram rod stiff the whole time. "So you see, it should be us apologizing to you for taking away from your child's precious time. I assure you it will not happen again."

My ma nodded in a jerky motion. "Thank you."

The headmistress smiled. "You are free to go."

I jumped out of my chair and ran to the door. All the guys were waiting outside and their light chatter stopped as my ma and I came out.

Her hand wrapped around my elbow with such strength I had no choice but to turn around.

"What's suddenly made you think you can get away with doing whatever you want?" she asked me, shaking her head as if disappointed. "You used to be such an obedient daughter, polite, never talked back. What has this place done to you? I never should have agreed to you even applying here."

I disentangled myself from her hold and took a step back. I felt my friends fall back behind me. Ashton's hand gently rubbed circles on my back.

I lifted my chin and said, "What's changed is that in this place I've finally found people who believe in me. That was all it took."

As my ma's mouth flapped open and closed, stunned by the new world I was showing to her, I realized that this was what I had to do. This was my calling. A dream I could come true with my friends. For so long I'd silenced myself, thinking I didn't have a right to say what was on my mind. But I had a mission now, use my voice for those who felt like they didn't have one.

Let the world know that we the young have shit to say.

The Best Rock Band of Our Time A short article by Ellen Young for Teen Stars Magazine

A short article by Ellen Young for Teen Stars Magazine Hi, guys! It's so great to meet you and be able to take a few minutes of your packed agenda to just have a nice chat.

Hi, guys! It's so great to meet you and be able to take a few minutes of your packed agenda to just have a nice chat. Hi, guys! It's so great to meet you and be able to take a few minutes of your packed agenda to just have a nice chat. Quinn: It's really great to meet you as well.

Vera: Your articles are wonderful, we're so lucky you decided to choose us for a feature, really.

Quinn:

Vera: Thank you so much! It feels surreal to get praise from the #1 hard rock band of the year.

Thank you so much! It feels surreal to get praise from the #1 hard rock band of the year. Thank you so much! It feels surreal to get praise from the #1 hard rock band of the year. Ashton: It's not praise when it's pure facts, you know? We read your articles while we're on tour, it's humbling to read about people who are doing greater things for society.

Ellen: You're going to make me blush.

Ashton:

Ellen: We've all followed your development from your early Youtube days, but how was it for you, personally, to be high school students and suddenly be propelled to international fame?

We've all followed your development from your early Youtube days, but how was it for you, personally, to be high school students and suddenly be propelled to international fame? Madison: I always knew I was destined for greatness — ow, guys! Stop hitting me. I was just joking.

Link: What she means to say is that it was a roller coaster ride. One second we're wannabes, just teens playing at rockstars, and the next second we were being recognized in the streets. It was so weird and for a while it went to our heads too much. Especially this one here.

Madison: Hey!

Vera: For me it was terrifying. I was used to being a total wallflower, and it was embarrassing as hell to suddenly be in the public eye. I guess a lot of people dream of fame, but fame also means scrutiny and the loss of privacy. One wrong move, no matter how small, could even be the end of our dreams. I thought I was going to be freer by pursuing what I wanted to do instead of what society demanded of me, but instead I had to be even more careful.

Ellen: That makes sense. But what do you mean you were a total wallflower? I can't possibly believe that!

Ashton: She's a looker.

Madison: A total babe.

Quinn: I agree.

Link: She's alright.

Vera: Gee, stop y'all.

How was it like to sign with Fueled by Udon and be label mates with bands that you grew up admiring, and then beating them at awards in the same categories? Ashton: Absolutely and unequivocally flabbergasting. Not even in my wildest dreams would I have imagined that happening. I think I cried the day we signed our contract with the label.

Link: You think? You wept like a babe.

Madison: And I have pictures to prove it.

Ellen: Can I see any?

Madison: Let me see if I have some on my phone... Hah, there we go. Look at him, all sorts of things running down his face.

Ellen: Aw, but that's the face of utter happiness right there.

Quinn: That's the face of someone who has worked harder than anybody else at making his dream come true, and the second when it does. I think Ash was by far the most affected of us that night.

Ashton:

Quinn:

Did you all have a dream of making it big in the music industry?

Did you all have a dream of making it big in the music industry? Did you all have a dream of making it big in the music industry? Quinn: To be honest, no. That was all Ashton and Lincoln's deal from the get go. I was seriously gunning for the MLB, actually.

Ellen: Really? One of my best friends is a junior coach in the MLB and her boyfriend is a pro baller.

Quinn: Oh yeah! I've seen them on your articles.

Ellen: What about you, ladies?

Vera: I was just determined to go to college. I didn't even know what to study. All I wanted was to get as far away from where I grew up as possible and what do you know, life gave me precisely that down a completely different path!

Madison: I was pretty adrift in my life back then. It's no secret that some of us come from families with large fortunes, but being the embodiment of a living porcelain doll and marrying a rich man was not really the life I wanted for myself. My parents and I got into a lot of fights about it and I almost got disowned when I dyed my hair black, and then again when I chopped it all off into a pixie cut. To them appearance really had been all that mattered. But then we started being successful commercially and suddenly they were proud of me. That was rough, and it still is, but I'm happy with my newfound purpose of being the best goddamn bassist in the industry, regardless of how feminine or not I may be perceived as.

That's incredible, I can't imagine how drastic the changes in your lives were like back then. Yet, you all seem so down to earth. Why do you think that is? Ashton: My twin brother, Ayrton, and my aunt Jem probably take the credit for me not becoming a self entitled douchebag.

Ellen: Ayrton Winters, the movie director?

Ashton: The one and only. My family have been my rock ever since I graduated high school and begun the pursuit of this crazy career.

Vera: Ahem.

Ashton: Plus, Vera would probably smack me to death with her cute little hands if I let success get to my head.

Quinn: My parents for me. My mom can still reduce me to a small child with a single look.

Madison: The same look works wonders on me, too. It can be quite scary. I'm glad she mostly seems to like me.

Vera: For me it's my best friends Leticia Colón and Adele Holt. Leti's become a huge Youtube influencer with her makeup tutorials and Addy's working to be a fashion designer. The fact that we've all supported each other as we work toward our interests has been a gift. My little brother Victor deserves a shoutout, too. He buys our albums with his earnings from his part time job and will brag about us to anybody who cares to listen.

Ellen: That is so sweet.

How do you balance your romantic life with the work and the fame? Doesn't it get complicated? Madison: It's certainly got complicated a couple of times, but we've dealt with it. We're adults.

Quinn: So you say now, but I do recall that you threw your shoe at my head once.

Madison: I learned the move from Vera. It's called the flying chancla, okay?

Vera: All latinos know about this, it's our biggest fear.

Ellen: Interesting point. Are there any marriage talks for the two couples?

Madison: It's a mystery! Maybe we'll just elope in secret.

Madison: It's not always wrong to rebel. Only you can define what your life should be, really.

Quinn: Practice makes perfect. No kidding. You need to have perseverance to get results.

Ashton: It sounds corny, but follow your dreams. You'll find your mission in them.

i have a confession to make to y'all. i'm not entirely sure how i feel about this story. for all intents and purposes it was a commercial failure. it did so abysmally bad in terms of attracting new readers and i felt so dismayed while posting it. the fact that i didn't feel super confident about it didn't help anyway (and come to think, surely that's linked to it not doing so well). i was also spoiled by how well HALL OF FAME did, considering it was a debut. i thought that kind of readership would carry over. alas.

this does NOT take away from the love and appreciation i feel for the readers of WE THE YOUNG <3 you guys are what kept me going. thank you for the taquitos and the enchiladas. and yes, Reader Awards will happen once more! stay tuned for those.

i also don't regret posting it! i'm proud of the fact that i finished it — and that i posted three days per week without fail as i said i would. it's been a good writing year for me and WE THE YOUNG was a big part of me getting my groove back. for that reason alone it has a soft spot in my writerly heart <3

in other news, in two days i'll post a teaser of my next story! i hope you guys will like it :)

Vera has always dreamt of being a singer, but is held back by her judgmental mother, a former singer herself who shames Vera for her size.





Ashton is no longer afraid of letting his parents down, and when he meets Vera he realizes that with her voice and his songs maybe he can stop being a disappointment to himself.





Together, they set out to become the best rock band of our time because We, The Young have sh*t to say.

so, this is a rewrite.

full disclosure, most of you may not know but i've been writing for thirteen years now (holy guacamole, way to date myself), with humble beginnings in obscure anime fanfiction thankyouverymuch. it took me four years to move on to posting my first original novel online, created purely to satisfy my own music snobbery. and IT WAS SO BAD but i was SO PROUD of myself that i thought it was the best thing since sliced bread.

(side note: you're seeing a lot of food references here because i'm hungry)

it was maybe a couple of years after i'd finished posting it that i realized it sucked . the plot was too slow. descriptions were too long-winded. dialogue wasn't snappy. my main characters didn't make things happen, things happened to them, etc. i deleted it from the interwebz six years ago, never to be seen again.

it sucked to imagine my surprise as i'm writing HALL OF FAME at the beginning of this year, when my mind slaps me in the face, grabs me by the collar and screams at me: YOU WILL REMAKE IT, AND IT WILL BE 100% DIFFERENT. and because i'm a wimp i just said, YES, MASTER and got to work.

so here we are. the planets have aligned and i've completely revamped something i wrote ten years ago. life's weird, man.

♥ still, i hope you like it! ♥

disclaimer time (please read in its entirety):

disclaimer time (please read in its entirety): - i'll update monday, wednesday and friday for as long as i can and/or run out of pre-written chapters. sometimes shit happens, so i kindly ask you for your patience.

- my main character is venezuelan (yay!), and so is her mother. they occasionally use spanish words/sentences/slang. i will not translate it in text. people don't say something in one language and then repeat it in another one. you should be able to understand by context. if this ruffles your feathers and you leave a rude comment about it, you're bye bye to me. no ifs and buts.

- this is different from HALL OF FAME in many ways. it can be read as a standalone because the characters are not related. it's also going to be a tad longer.

- there will be colorful language because... hi, it me, a potty mouth.

- do not steal any part of my work.

- be respectful in comments.

- do enjoy and if you do, spread the word!
