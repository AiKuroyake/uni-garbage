    "Wattpad is a website where anyone can share their own stories. Although a lot of nowadays popular writers started on Wattpad (and who have written generally good fiction), it still has a reputation of a very cringe place full of sexually oriented fanfictions. In the Czech republic, we even have a Facebook page called [Ãšlovky z Wattpadu](https://www.facebook.com/ulovkyzwattpadu) which shares snippets of the worst stories written in Czech (but it's really funny if you don't have to read the whole story).\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to check 30 stories which won 2020 Wattys Award to see if it is true that Wattpad stories generally lack quality and are full of sexual or explicit content.\n",

    "## Getting the data\n",
    "\n",
    "I used my own [fork](https://github.com/AiKuroyake/Wattpad2Epub) of [Wattpad2Epub](https://github.com/GatoLoko/Wattpad2Epub) script. Wattpad2Epub allows you download Wattpad stories easily and save them in epub format. I have done some minor changes to the code, that's why I used my version.\n",
    "\n",
    "After downloading 30 stories from [The Wattys 2020 Award Winners](https://www.wattpad.com/list/996419659-the-2020-wattys-award-winners), I needed to convert epub format of the stories to txt, so I can process it with Python. I used [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) for this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cleaning the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Every book starts with Introduction containing synopsis, chapter list, and info about the book. I wanted as clean data as I could so I decided to delete these. Unfortunately, every book contains a bit different Introduction, so I had to go over them manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted to remove authors' notes from the books, too. There was the same problem as with introduction. I had to delete the notes manually. Unfortunately, after scrolling through few stories, I found out there are authors' notes in between chapters. Not in all stories and not after every chapter. I left these notes there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost every story contains images. A following line is displayed instead of images: _Oops! This image does not follow our content guidelines. To continue publishing, please remove it or upload a different image._ I removed it using replace() method when reading the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "I did not remove _Chapter 1_ or similar headings. I also left numbers, stop words, and other tokens in the texts. These tokens will not spoil my results in no way."
