    "Today we will have a look at the last type of annotations provided by the basic spaCy pipeline: *Named Entity Recognition*. Named entities are typically proper names (e.g. names of persons, places or organizations). Sometimes also other types of expressions are included in this category, e.g. temporal expressions (\"last January\") or quantities (\"100 000 euros\"). Especially for news and generally text that reports on events, the most essential information is usually encoded in the named entities.\n",
